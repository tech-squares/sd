/* You should compile this file (and might as well compile all the others
   too) with some indicator symbol defined that tells what language system
   semantics are to be provided.  This program requires at least POSIX.
   A better random number generator mechanism (48 bits) is provided under
   System 5 (_SYS5_SOURCE), OSF (_AES_SOURCE), XOPEN (_XOPEN_SOURCE), or
   some proprietary systems, so you should define such a symbol if your
   system provides those semantics.  If not, you should just turn on
   _POSIX_SOURCE.  Normally, this is done on the compiler invocation line
   (in the Makefile, or whatever) with some incantation like "-D_AES_SOURCE".

   We recommend _AES_SOURCE over _XOPEN_SOURCE, since the latter doesn't
   seem to recognize that 20th century programmers use include files with
   prototypes for library functions in them.  Under OSF/AES, the file
   stdlib.h has the necessary stuff.  Under XOPEN, you are expected to
   copy the prototypes by hand from the printed manual into your program.
   For those who absolutely must use XOPEN, we have done the necessary
   copying below.

   On HP-UX, we recommend turning on _AES_SOURCE for the reason given
   above.  You could also turn on _HPUX_SOURCE to get the routines,
   if you have no aversion to proprietary system semantics.

   On SUN-OS, giving no symbol will get SUN-OS semantics, which gets the
   48-bit routines, if you have no aversion to proprietary system semantics.
   This is what the "defined(sun)" is for.
