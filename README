Introduction
************

   Sd is a square dance caller's helper.  The program assists in
writing sequences for Western square dancing by doing the checker
pushing.  You tell the program what call you want to call next, and it
computes the resulting setup and shows it to you.

   Several user interfaces are available.  They come in two general
types, and the program name is different for these types.

   Sd is the name of the program that uses menus and a "graphical user
interface".  Calls are selected by clicking with the mouse on the chosen
menu item.  The principal version of Sd runs on Unix-like systems with
the X Window System interface.  Sd is also available for Domain/OS on
Apollo systems, and on the Macintosh.  It is not yet available for PC
compatibles.

   Sdtty is the name of the program that uses a character-oriented
keyboard interface.  Calls are selected by typing their names.  Sdtty
runs on Unix-like systems and under DOS on PC compatibles.

Documentation
=============

   The file `INSTALL' contains instructions for building and installing
Sd and for formatting and printing its documentation.  If you have
received the program in pre-built form, you shouldn't need to read it.

   The files `sd_doc.txt' and `sd_doc.ps' are this manual, in plain
text and formatted form, respectively.  The file `db_doc.txt' gives
internal information on the database format, useful only to people
editing the calls database.

   See the file `Relnotes' for information about what is new in this
release.

   Printed copies of the manual are available from the authors, or may
be printed from the file `sd_doc.ps'.

Getting Sd or Sdtty
===================

   You can obtain Sdtty for DOS on PC-compatible computers, on a
3.5-inch HD disk, with printed documentation.  The price is $4 (price
valid for 1995).  If you want sources, or a different format instead,
please say so.

   To install the program from a floppy disk to a PC-compatible, change
to the desired directory, insert the disk, and type `A:INSTALL' or
`B:INSTALL' as appropriate.

   Sd is also available via anonymous FTP from the directory `misc/sd/'
on host ftp.x.org.  FTP is the Internet file transfer protocol.  The
file `sd-nn.tar.Z' (where `nn' changes with the version) is a
compressed Unix-format "tar" file containing the sources.  The file
`sdxxxbn.exe' (where `xxx' changes with the version) is a
self-extracting DOS archive containing a pre-built executable of Sdtty
for PC-compatible computers.

   You must run FTP in binary mode to obtain these files.

   Versions for the Macintosh, and binaries for other systems, may be
available also.  See the file `README' at the FTP site for availability,

   If your mailer can interpret MIME messages, we can also send you Sd
by email.  MIME is a draft Internet standard for structured mail, and
it includes support for mailing large binary files.

   If you are on the Internet, you can read Sd documentation using the
World Wide Web.  Give the locator http://www.x.org/misc/sd/ to your WWW
program.

   Sd and Sdtty are "free" programs, in that they are licensed under the
GNU General Public License, which is an appendix to this manual.  In
short, this means that it is perfectly legal and ethical to copy and
redistribute the program and documentation.  For example, you may
obtain the program by having a friend copy the disk and manual for you.
(Or just copy the disk, and print your own manual from the the file
that is on the disk.)

   Sd and Sdtty are sometimes also distributed in source form.  The
licensing terms for distribution of source files, or programs made from
modified source files, are very strict.  Programs constructed from
modified source files may never be duplicated or redistributed by
anyone, even in binary form, without obeying the conditions of the
license.  Read the license carefully.
