This is Sd for POSIX.1/X11 systems.  Time-stamp: <93/04/09 17:42:58 gildea>

ABOUT SD:

Sd is a square dance caller's helper.  The program assists in writing
material for Western square dancing by doing the checker pushing.  You
tell the program what call you want to call next, and it computes the
resulting setup and shows it to you.

There are several user interfaces available with Sd.  The standard is
an X Window System interface.  Also included is a terminal-based user
interface featuring a completing reader.  Support for Apollo's Domain
Dialog is available from the authors, but is not part of the
distribution.

The file INSTALL contains instructions for building and installing Sd.

The file sd_doc.txinfo documents using Sd.  The file database.doc
gives internal information on the database format, useful only to
people editing the calls database.

See the file Relnotes for information about what is new in this release.


DOCUMENTATION:

The file sd_doc.txinfo is in Texinfo format.  You can run it through TeX
to produce a printed manual, or you can format it for use with
Info, a hypertext documentation reader.

Support for Texinfo-style documentation is distributed as part of
Emacs and as stand-alone package, both available via anonymous ftp
from prep.ai.mit.edu and other GNU software archives.

Both the Emacs and Texinfo distributions contain texinfo.tex, the
macros required to print the document with TeX.  In Emacs, use M-x
texinfo-format-buffer to convert to Info, and use M-x info to read the
document.  In the Texinfo package, "makeinfo" converts to Info, and
"info" is the reader; both are C programs.

You can use the following "make" commands to format the documentation:

make info			convert to Info format
make dvi			run through TeX.  Use this to make hardcopy.

In future releases we may also distribute pre-formatted versions of
the documentation.


GETTING SD:

Sd is available via anonymous FTP from the file contrib/c4/sd/sd-nn.tar.Z
(where "nn" changes with the version) on host export.lcs.mit.edu.
FTP is the Internet file transfer protocol.

If your mailer can interpret MIME messages, we can also send you Sd
