Introduction
************

   Sd is a square dance caller's helper.  The program assists in
writing sequences for Western square dancing by doing the checker
pushing.  You tell the program what call you want to call next, and it
computes the resulting setup and shows it to you.

   There are several user interfaces available with Sd.  The standard is
an X Window System interface.  Also included is a terminal-based user
interface featuring a completing reader that runs on both Unix systems
and DOS, and a Macintosh interface.  Support for Apollo's Domain Dialog
is available from the authors, but is not part of the distribution.

Documentation
=============

   The file `INSTALL' contains instructions for building and installing
Sd and for formatting and printing its documentation.

   The file `sd_doc.txinfo' documents using Sd.  The file `db_doc.txt'
gives internal information on the database format, useful only to
people editing the calls database.

   See the file `Relnotes' for information about what is new in this
release.

   Printed copies of the manual are available from the authors.

Getting Sd
==========

   Sd is available via anonymous FTP from the directory
`contrib/c4/sd/' on host ftp.x.org.  FTP is the Internet file transfer
protocol.  The file `sd-nn.tar.Z' (where `nn' changes with the version)
is a compressed tar file containing the sources.  The file
`sdxxxbn.exe' (where `xxx' changes with the version) is a
self-extracting DOS archive containing a pre-built executable.

   If your mailer can interpret MIME messages, we can also send you Sd
by email.  MIME is a draft Internet standard for structured mail.  It
includes support for mailing large binary files, such as a tar file of
Sd.
