		   RELEASE NOTES FOR SD VERSION 30.7
		 Database version = 30.7 format = 44,
    X11 UI version 1.15, SDTTY UI version 1.6, MAC UI version 2.2.

Took out the words "end-to-end" for those versions of concepts like
triple lines or split phantom columns that place the setups end-to-end.
The program will just figure it out.  So will your dancers.

New concept: matrix.  The word "matrix" must precede the concept to which it
applies, as in "matrix split phantom lines".  Matrix may be used with the
usual phantom concepts, as well as with "split" and "each 1x4".  It may
also be used with "standard", as in "heads ARE STANDARD IN MATRIX SPLIT
PHANTOM LINES slim down".

New calls: [cross] kick by <n>.  Double/triple star thru.  Square thru
etc. to a wave.  Square thru but on the <Nth> hand (courtesy of Dave
Decot).  Drop in/out are now legal from facing diamonds.  Many
minor improvements.

New concepts: all 4 couples and all 8.  Inner dual boxes.

I have yielded to massive pressure and allowed "bigblock" and "stagger" to
be applicable to any kind of distorted lines or columns respectively.
So bigblock is legal in a butterfly or "O".

It now prints the "1/2" correctly in things like "reflected [1/2 tag]" and
"[revert [1/2 flip]] motivate".  It used to take the "1/2" out, with
disastrous results, in the mistaken belief that these calls were like
"[flip] your neighbor".

The plural of "beau" is now spelled "beaus", in accordance with the
Callerlab C1 list (but not the C1 definitions!)

It now enforces the rules for the "stretch" concept: the call must be a
4-person call, split along the same axis as the stretching axis.

In general, "stretch", "central", and "crazy" work much better than formerly.

The "so-and-so do something" concepts have been extensively rewritten.
There are four related concepts:
    "<so-and-so> only"
    "<so-and-so> disconnected"
    "<so-and-so> do your part"
    "own the <so-and-so>"
Briefly, they mean the following:
    "<so-and-so> only" means that the designees work among themselves
         in whatever undistorted setups they can find.
    "<so-and-so> disconnected" means that the designees work in whatever
         setup they find after removing the non-designees.
    "<so-and-so> do your part" means that the designees work in the
         original setup, with the non-designees replaced by phantoms.
    "own the <so-and-so>" is like "do your part", except that strict
         matrix positioning is used.
Read the section "so-and-so only" in the manual for details.

Note that the prior inability to have, for example, the girls hinge from
a BGGBBGGB grand wave to make point-to-point diamonds, is now fixed.
It can be done in any of the following ways:
   each 1x4 centers hinge
   girls only hinge
   girls disconnected hinge

A warning is printed for non-interacting use of "multiple formations working",
"interlocked phantom setups", and "phantom setups" concepts.  That is,
things like "triple boxes working together scoot back", "grand working right
star thru", "interlocked phantom lines swing thru", and "phantom columns
double pass thru" give a warning.  In the case of "interlocked phantom setups"
and "phantom setups", you should use "split phantom setups" instead.  I
would prefer to have the program require "quadruple setups" instead, but
the "quadruple setups" concept is generally C4, while some of the
"phantom setups" and "interlocked phantom setups" concepts are C3 or C3A.
The "resolve", "reconcile", and "pick random call" operations will not
choose calls that give this warning.

The call "counter" is now more literate about the subtleties of "left",
"interlocked", and "cross".  "Central counter" is literate also.

The concept "once removed" is now legal in once removed diamonds.  The concept
"once removed diamonds" still exists.

In honor of Clark Baker, the concept "once removed" is now legal in
dog-bone setups and point-to-point diamonds.

It now recognizes a number of getouts from squared sets.

It now accepts certain combinations of stacked fractionalization concepts,
such as "REVERSE ORDER 2/3 (fractional) remake" or "DO THE LAST 2/3:
REVERSE ORDER remake", which are, of course, equivalent.  It can also
do RANDOM and PIECEWISE on fractionalized and/or reversed calls.
Also, if a call is executed "crazy" (or fractional crazy or reverse crazy)
the crazy concept provides the fractionalization.  Hence, it is permissible
to say things like "random stable crazy mix".  In such a case, the two parts
of the "mix" are irrelevant.  The "crazy mix" has 4 parts.

Note that
      1/4 stable random crazy
and
      random 1/4 stable crazy
are very different.

The "centers and ends/two calls in succession/undo/undo" bug was fixed.
You don't want to know.

The bug that allowed things like "ends circulate" or "team up" from a
starting DPT has been fixed.  Also, things like "ends flutter wheel" from
a starting DPT or from facing lines is now illegal.

Before writing a sequence to the transcript file, it now checks to see whether
a control-Z character exists at the end of that file, and removes same.  Some
editors on PC's have been observed placing such characters at the end of a
file, and some printing software stops when it encounters a control-Z,
resulting in inability to print files with more than one sequence.

There are new concepts: "PRECEDE IT BY" and "FOLLOW IT BY", which take
two calls.  They perform the first call (first in textual order, that is)
*before* or *after*, respectively, the second.  For example, "FOLLOW IT BY roll,
swing thru", does a swing thru and roll.  There is only one context in which
these concepts are sensible -- they can be the subject of the PIECEWISE,
RANDOM, or REVERSE RANDOM meta-concepts.  For example, "PIECEWISE FOLLOW IT
BY criss cross the deucey, turn the key" will do a criss cross the deucey
after each of the three parts of turn the key.

These concepts are among the situations in which the program does not attempt
to print out the exact words that are appropriate to use when calling, but
instead prints out an unambiguous description of what is supposed to happen.
The exact words you should use depend on the context and on your judgement.
You might say "piecewise add a criss cross the deucey, and turn the key",
or "do a criss cross the deucey after each part, and turn the key", or
something similar.

Please read the new section "linguistic idiosyncrasies" in the manual.
