		   RELEASE NOTES FOR SD VERSION 30.74
		 Database version = 30.74 format = 45,
    X11 UI version 1.15, SDTTY UI version 1.6, MAC UI version 2.2.

Took out the words "end-to-end" for those versions of concepts like
triple lines or split phantom columns that place the setups end-to-end.
The program will just figure it out.  So will your dancers.

New concept: matrix.  The word "matrix" must precede the concept to which it
applies, as in "matrix split phantom lines".  Matrix may be used with the
usual phantom concepts, as well as with "split" and "each 1x4".  It may
also be used with "standard", as in "heads ARE STANDARD IN MATRIX SPLIT
PHANTOM LINES slim down".

New concepts: all 4 couples and all 8.  Inner dual boxes.

New concept: mirror.  This can apply to any call, and does a complete
mirror reversal of it, including the act of taking right hands if
dancers meet at the end.  That is, dancers will actually take left hands
in this case.  Calls modified by "left" or "reverse" do not have this
property -- dancers come to physical right hands.  Hence "left chain reaction"
only affects the hinge (if necessary), but "mirror chain reaction" also
causes dancers to come to left hands if they meet at the end of the call.
"Mirror left chain reaction" would of course use a right-handed hinge and
then come to left hands at the end.

New concepts: assume <whatever> for several values of <whatever>, such
as waves, two-faced lines, magic columns, facing lines, etc.  Also, there
is a concept "with active phantoms" that can be used after these.  Please
see the manual for a discussion of what these concepts mean.  The
implementation of these concepts is in a rather incomplete state at present.

New calls: [cross] kick by <n>.  Double/triple star thru.  Square thru
etc. to a wave.  Square thru but on the <Nth> hand (courtesy of Dave
Decot).  Drop in/out are now legal from facing diamonds.  Many
minor improvements.

"Bigblock" and "stagger" are now applicable to any kind of distorted
lines or columns respectively.  So "bigblock" is legal in a butterfly or "O".

It now prints a "line" number next to each call, both in the displayed
sequence and the transcript file.  Users are commonly quick to condemn
any change in a program's appearance.  Please give this version a try.
Some users have asked for this feature.  If people really dislike it,
I will take it out.

It now prints the "1/2" correctly in things like "reflected [1/2 tag]" and
"[revert [1/2 flip]] motivate".  It used to take the "1/2" out, with
disastrous results, in the mistaken belief that these calls were like
"[flip] your neighbor".

The plural of "beau" is now spelled "beaus", in accordance with the
Callerlab C1 list (but not the C1 definitions!)

It now enforces the rules for the "stretch" concept: the call must be a
4-person call, split along the same axis as the stretching axis.

In general, "stretch", "central", and "crazy" work much better than formerly.

The "so-and-so do something" concepts have been extensively rewritten.
There are four related concepts:
    "<so-and-so> only"
    "<so-and-so> disconnected"
    "<so-and-so> do your part"
    "own the <so-and-so>"
Briefly, they mean the following:
    "<so-and-so> only" means that the designees work among themselves
         in whatever undistorted setups they can find.
    "<so-and-so> disconnected" means that the designees work in whatever
         setup they find after removing the non-designees.
    "<so-and-so> do your part" means that the designees work in the
         original setup, with the non-designees replaced by phantoms.
    "own the <so-and-so>" is like "do your part", except that strict
         matrix positioning is used.
Please read the section "so-and-so only" in the manual for details.

Note that the prior inability to have, for example, the girls hinge from
a BGGBBGGB grand wave to make point-to-point diamonds, is now fixed.
It can be done in any of the following ways:
   each 1x4 centers hinge
   girls only hinge
   girls disconnected hinge

A warning is printed for non-interacting use of "multiple formations working",
"interlocked phantom setups", and "phantom setups" concepts.  That is,
things like "triple boxes working together scoot back", "grand working right
star thru", "interlocked phantom lines swing thru", and "phantom columns
double pass thru" give a warning.  The "resolve", "reconcile", and "pick
random call" operations will not choose calls that give this warning.
In the case of "interlocked phantom setups" and "phantom setups", you should
use "split phantom setups" instead.  I would have preferred to have the
required concept be "quadruple setups", but the "quadruple setups" concept
is generally C4, while some of the "phantom setups" and "interlocked phantom
setups" concepts are C3 or C3A.

The call "counter" is now more literate about the subtleties of "left",
"interlocked", and "cross".  "Central counter" is literate also.

The concept "once removed" is now legal in once removed diamonds.  The concept
"once removed diamonds" still exists.

In honor of Clark Baker, the concept "once removed" is now legal in
dog-bone setups and point-to-point diamonds.

It now recognizes a number of getouts from squared sets.

It now accepts certain combinations of stacked fractionalization concepts,
such as "REVERSE ORDER 2/3 (fractional) remake" or "DO THE LAST 2/3:
REVERSE ORDER remake", which are, of course, equivalent.  It can also
do RANDOM and PIECEWISE on fractionalized and/or reversed calls.
Also, if a call is executed "crazy" (or fractional crazy or reverse crazy)
the crazy concept provides the fractionalization.  Hence, it is permissible
to say things like "random stable crazy mix".  In such a case, the two parts
of the "mix" are irrelevant.  The "crazy mix" has 4 parts.

Note that
      1/4 stable random crazy
and
      random 1/4 stable crazy
are very different.

The "centers and ends/two calls in succession/undo/undo" bug was fixed.
You don't want to know.

The bug that allowed things like "ends circulate" or "team up" from a
starting DPT has been fixed.  Also, things like "ends flutter wheel" from
a starting DPT or from facing lines is now illegal.

The "allow modifications" icon only needs to be clicked on (or typed)
once to get the full range of modifications.  There are no longer two
levels of modifiability.

A few function keys have been defined for the PC.  Pressing the following
keys is equivalent to entering the indicated text.  Future versions of the
program will have the ability to have a customization file indicate what
keys are bound to what strings.
           f1 => "split phantom lines"
   shift   f1 => "interlocked phantom lines"
   control f1 => "phantom lines"
           f2 => "split phantom columns"
   shift   f2 => "interlocked phantom columns"
   control f2 => "phantom columns"
           f3 => "allow modifications"
           f4 => "<anything>"

The bug that made it crash if an extremely long line was typed to sdtty
has been fixed.  We thank Lynette Bellini's cat for finding this bug.

Before writing a sequence to the transcript file, it now checks to see whether
a control-Z character exists at the end of that file, and removes same.  Some
editors on PC's have been observed placing such characters at the end of a
file, and some printing software stops when it encounters a control-Z,
resulting in inability to print files containing sequences that were
appended after the file was edited.

There are new concepts: "PRECEDE IT BY" and "FOLLOW IT BY", which take
two calls.  They perform the first call (first in textual order, that is)
*before* or *after*, respectively, the second.  For example, "FOLLOW IT BY roll,
swing thru", does a swing thru and roll.  There is only one context in which
these concepts are sensible -- they can be the subject of the PIECEWISE,
RANDOM, or REVERSE RANDOM meta-concepts.  For example, "PIECEWISE FOLLOW IT
BY criss cross the deucey, turn the key" will do a criss cross the deucey
after each of the three parts of turn the key.  Please see the manual for
further discussion of the linguistic implications of these.

Please read the new section "linguistic idiosyncrasies" in the manual.
