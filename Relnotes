		    RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 28.6
       Database version = 28.5, format = 34, X11 UI version 1.13.

28.6:

Installation instructions moved from README to new file INSTALL.
Renamed "relnotes.archive" to "oldnotes".
Documentation expanded.

28.5:

New calls:  Eight chain N.

A bug was fixed in tandem/couples/siamese that could make it switch the paired
people with each other if the call being executed involved stepping to a wave
or rearing back from one.  This seems to have been introduced at about the time
that fractional twosom/solid was added.  This bug is serious.

28.4:

New calls:  [single] rotate from 6x1 and 8x1 columns.  Also, the concept "single"
is now used to get single rotate -- single rotate is not separately listed in the menu.
The call "single file rotate" is now listed separately.  This is the 4x1 call.
The calls "little, ends go as you are" and "plenty, ends go as you are" were added.
These are intended to be called from diamonds.  Exactly how you would say these
calls may depend on the audience.  Many callers and dancers believe that one
could just say "little" or "plenty" from these setups.  Some very fussy people
believe that the definition is always quarter right, counter rotate, and roll,
meaning that one must tell the ends to go as they are in order to get the
intended effect.

Build changes:

default Makefile replaced by Makefile.in and configure.  See README
for new build procedures.  If you are using xmkmf, the procedure does
not change.

28.3:

User Interface changes:

Name of old sequence file displayed in prompt for new name.

X11:
Level included in icon name.

sdtty:
Documented the terminal interface in a new chapter of sd_doc.txinfo.

Added these commands: ^Z (stop), ESC (complete, like TAB),
^U (kill line), and % (comment).

28.2:

Fixed bug that made things like "bigblock checkerbox" not work.

It can now do two-person calls between people directly lined up in
a quarter tag.  After "heads spin the top" (which leaves the boys
facing directly), you can do "SO-AND-SO ONLY", select boys, and
do things like pass thru or slide thru.
