		    RELEASE NOTES FOR SD VERSION 28.64
       Database version = 28.52, format = 34, X11 UI version 1.13.

28.64:

Implemented database reading ticks for sdtty only.

sd.c renamed sdconcpt.c

New file readme.txinfo.

Changed address of Sd mailing lists to expo.lcs.mit.edu.

README file now exactly the Introduction of the manual; they are
generated from the same source.

Added "Getting Started" chapter to the manual.  It is supposed to be a
gentle introduction for people who aren't going to read the whole
manual.  Have I succeeded?

28.62:
The file dbcompile.c has been changed to dbcomp.c .  Makefile fix fixed.

Slightly improved getout detection (it can see cross by, left allemande
from thars and crossed waves, for example.)

28.61:
The database compiler now consists of two files: dbcompile.c (later changed
to dbcomp.c) and mkcalls.c .  The Makefiles have been changed to reflect this.

Database format:  Added new qualifier "in_or_out", and improved qualifier
"wave_only", to make centers' part of "bits and "pieces" work authentically.

Added very rudimentary awareness of thar setups.

New calls: slip the clutch, fractional tops, cross by.

28.6:

Installation instructions moved from README to new file INSTALL.
Renamed "relnotes.archive" to "oldnotes".
Documentation expanded.

28.5:

New calls:  Eight chain N.

A bug was fixed in tandem/couples/siamese that could make it switch the paired
people with each other if the call being executed involved stepping to a wave
or rearing back from one.  This seems to have been introduced at about the time
that fractional twosom/solid was added.  This bug is serious.

28.4:

New calls: [single] rotate from 6x1 and 8x1 columns.  Also, the
concept "single" is now used to get single rotate -- single rotate is
not separately listed in the menu.  The call "single file rotate" is
now listed separately.  This is the 4x1 call.  The calls "little, ends
go as you are" and "plenty, ends go as you are" were added.
These are intended to be called from diamonds.  Exactly how you would say these
calls may depend on the audience.  Many callers and dancers believe that one
could just say "little" or "plenty" from these setups.  Some very fussy people
believe that the definition is always quarter right, counter rotate, and roll,
meaning that one must tell the ends to go as they are in order to get the
intended effect.

Build changes:

The default Makefile is replaced by Makefile.in and configure.  See
README (since changed to INSTALL) for the new build procedures.  If you are using xmkmf, the
procedure does not change.  If you had to use Makefile before, chances
were you had to edit it by hand.  Now "configure" does the editing for
you.

28.3:

User Interface changes:

Name of old sequence file displayed in prompt for new name.

X11:
Level included in icon name.

sdtty:
Documented the terminal interface in a new chapter of sd_doc.txinfo.

Added these commands: ^Z (stop), ESC (complete, like TAB),
^U (kill line), and % (comment).

28.2:

Fixed bug that made things like "bigblock checkerbox" not work.

It can now do two-person calls between people directly lined up in
a quarter tag.  After "heads spin the top" (which leaves the boys
facing directly), you can do "SO-AND-SO ONLY", select boys, and
do things like pass thru or slide thru.
