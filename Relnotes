		    RELEASE NOTES FOR SD VERSION 28.7
       Database version = 28.60, format = 40, X11 UI version 1.13.

Changes since 28.01:

The sdtty version runs under DOS.  See INSTALL for system requirements.

Call levels relating to C3A and C3 were updated to reflect the recent
voting in Callerlab.

The database version is now a string instead of two numbers.  It appears
in the database source file (sd_calls.txt) as a string in quotes, as in
          version "28.54"
This makes it possible for users who customize their own version of the
database to comply with section 2(a) of the GNU General Public License,
which requires that anyone who modifies any file to display that fact
when the program runs.  By changing the string to something like
          version "28.54(wba)"
the fact that a modified database is in use will be indicated at program
startup and will be stamped on each sequence that is written.

Made scoot and little/plenty/ramble etc. calls more rational.  All of
these calls now exist both by themselves and in their "scoot and ..." form.
When called by themselves, little, little more, plenty, and rally will
always have the outsides go to the right, even if the wave in the center
is left handed.  When called as part of a "scoot and" call, the outsides
are required by the call definition to go in the direction of the wave
handedness.  This is implemented by requiring you to give the "left"
modifier when the wave is left handed, which will make the outsides go
to the left.  You are not actually required to say the word "left"
when calling the resulting card, though it wouldn't hurt.

Changed the name of the concept formerly called "<anyone> ONLY" to
"<anyone> DO YOUR PART" to reflect more accurately the way this
rather unpleasant concept behaves.

Added the call "<anyone> trade".  This is what you should use in general
for telling people to trade.  The "<anyone> ONLY" concept (now called
"<anyone> DO YOUR PART") is not, has never been, and never will be the
right thing to use for this, a fact which people who have attempted to
use it have discovered to their dismay.  Use the call "<anyone> trade"
instead.  It has been designed to handle this call the way it is actually
used in practice.

The call "fold" is now much more nearly faithful to the way it is actually
done in practice.  Only the ends are allowed to fold.  Sorry.  Having
anyone else fold is yucky anyway.  You are allowed to designate the people
with other words, such as "girls fold", as long as the designated people
are in fact the ends.  As usual, click on "CROSS" in front of the call to
get this -- the program will move the word into the right place.

The call "peel the top" can now be done in the "Z" setup that is common
for this call.  The combination "girls fold and peel the top" now
works!

Added <anyone> run/cross run/kickoff/cross kickoff.  For cross run
and cross kickoff, the designees must be centers or ends, or their
equivalent.  As usual, click on "CROSS" in front of the call to get
this -- the program will move the word into the right place.

Fixed obscure bug in obscure call -- double down from columns.

New call: N/4 the deucey.  The only legal fractions are 1/4 and 3/4.
The ability to give different fractions, as in "2-1-3-3 quarter the deucey",
is not implemented.  Remember that, since "<N/4>" does not enter into
the alphabetization, this call is listed in the menu under "t".

More new calls: snap the tag, and all the usual variants thereof.
More new calls: 2x1 [magic] quick wrap.
More new calls: slip the clutch, fractional tops, cross by.
More new calls: eight chain N.

New calls: [single] rotate from 6x1 and 8x1 columns.  Also, the
concept "single" is now used to get single rotate -- single rotate is
not separately listed in the menu.  The call "single file rotate" is
now listed separately.  This is the 4x1 call.  The calls "little, ends
go as you are" and "plenty, ends go as you are" were added.
These are intended to be called from diamonds.  Exactly how you would say these
calls may depend on the audience.  Many callers and dancers believe that one
could just say "little" or "plenty" from these setups.  Some very fussy people
believe that the definition is always quarter right, counter rotate, and roll,
meaning that one must tell the ends to go as they are in order to get the
intended effect.

More types of resolves recognized, including "at home" from a "heads
up to the middle" setup.  (It is NOT recognized from a genuine squared
set -- some people must move into the middle to make a 2x4.)  The
"reconcile" command can search (with great difficulty!) for "at home"
getouts.

The "skew" and "skewsome" concepts are now implemented.  So are phantom
line and column shape-changers.  (These had already been implemented
for split phantom and interlocked phantom.)  It can now do
[split/interlocked] phantom lines/columns from a 1x16.

The usual sorts of improvements were made in the program's ability to
do various things.  For example, from a "rigger" setup (make a tidal
wave and have the center 4 recycle, so there is a box in the center
with miniwaves outside of it), it is now possible to tell the ends to
explode.  Also, from interlocked diamonds, "random siamese twosome
diamond chain thru" is now possible.  To do this, the third part of
diamond chain thru was changed from "center 4 in the 8-person setup
cast off 3/4" to "center 2 or 4 in the 4- or 8-person setup cast off 3/4".

The limit (8) on the number of parts that a sequentially defined call
may have has been removed.  This was formerly encoded as the constant
SEQDEF_MAX in the file database.h .  A call can now have any reasonable
number of parts.

The program is now less likely to crash if it runs out of memory.
If you are resolving (or reconciling, or "doing anything", etc.) and
you click on "find another" but nothing happens, it can't allocate any
memory for further resolves.  You would be well advised to write out
the sequence from among the resolves you already have.  Beware:  this
fix is not complete -- the program can still crash if run on a system
with insufficient memory.

Some of the changes that were made have had the unfortunate effect of
increasing the database size from 65400 bytes to 71200 bytes.

Slightly improved getout detection (it can see cross by, left allemande
from thars and crossed waves, for example.)

Database format:  Added new qualifier "in_or_out", and improved qualifier
"wave_only", to make centers' part of "bits and "pieces" work authentically.

Added very rudimentary awareness of "thar" setups.

A bug was fixed in tandem/couples/siamese that could make it switch the paired
people with each other if the call being executed involved stepping to a wave
or rearing back from one.  This seems to have been introduced at about the time
that fractional twosom/solid was added.  This bug is serious.

Fixed bug that made things like "bigblock checkerbox" not work.

It can now do two-person calls between people directly lined up in
a quarter tag.  After "heads spin the top" (which leaves the boys
facing directly), you can do things like "boys DO YOUR PART, slide thru".



DOCUMENTATION CHANGES:

COPYING updated to GPL v2 and included in manual.

Installation instructions moved from README to new file INSTALL.

Added "Getting Started" chapter to the manual.  It is supposed to be a
gentle introduction for people who aren't going to read the whole
manual.

Changed address of Sd mailing lists to expo.lcs.mit.edu.

Documented the terminal interface in a new chapter of sd_doc.txinfo.


BUILD CHANGES:

The default Makefile is replaced by Makefile.in and configure.  See
INSTALL for the new build procedures.  If you are using xmkmf, the
procedure does not change.  If you had to use Makefile before, chances
were you had to edit it by hand.  Now "configure" does the editing for
you.


USER INTERFACE CHANGES:

Name of old sequence file displayed in prompt for new name.

X11:
Level included in icon name.

sdtty:
Display database reading ticks.

Handle -db and -sequence command-line options.

Added these commands: ^Z (stop), ESC (complete, like TAB),
^U (kill line), and % (comment).


FILES:

Renamed "sd.c" to "sdconcpt.c".

New files INSTALL, readme.txinfo, and install.txinfo.

The database compiler now consists of two files:  dbcomp.c and mkcalls.c.

Renamed "relnotes.archive" to "oldnotes".
