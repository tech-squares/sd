		    RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 28.01
       Database version = 28.0, format = 34, X11 UI version 1.12.

===============================================================================
A bug was fixed in tandem/couples/siamese that could make it switch the paired
people with each other if the call being executed involved stepping to a wave
or rearing back from one.  This seems to have been introduced at about the time
that fractional twosome/solid was added.  This bug is serious.
===============================================================================

Fixed long-standing bug in so-and-so-based triangle calls.

Added support for sdtty, a version written by Alan Snyder with a
terminal-based user interface featuring a completing reader.  In
addition to running on Unix, this version has been ported to both
the Macintosh and the IBM PC.  Both ports are still experimental.
The source file "sdtables.c" has been split -- there is a new file
"sdctable.c".  If you use your own Makefile or other tools for
handling sources, you may need to update them.

Fixed the mechanism for dealing with calls that take 4x4 to 2x8 setups.

Fixed a bug that made the trace concept almost always consider the call
illegal.  It is a tribute to the immense popularity of this concept that
the bug went undetected for so long.

Fractional stability is now supported for the call "roll" and calls that
use same.  For example, fraction stable sidetrack now works.

Added a lot more knowledge about how to do "1/2 circulate" (and hence
tally ho and cover up) from T-boned 2x4's.

Repaired the inability to do "so-and-so are N/4 stable" stuff.

New calls: 3X3/4X4 roll out to a column and countershake.
2/3 countershake, including 3X3 and 4X4.
Grand fan the top and reverse the top from suitable 12 matrices.
Cross counterpoint, diamond counterpoint, diamond recoil.
Mix the deucey, touch tone, contour the line, replace the column
but [], shadow to a diamond, detach, sashay thru,
trap it, strike out, mix the deal, mix the turn & deal, fractionalizable
recycle.  Unfortunately, the latter had to be entered as a separate call --
"recycle (by parts)".  This is because there is no mechanism for a call to
be defined by parts from some setups and by array from others, and the
face-to-face recycle has no parts.  Since we need one call "recycle" that
is invoked by, for example, counterpoint, that call is defined by array
from both waves and facing couples.  The wave-only fractionalizable
recycle needs to be a separate call.  Use it only when doing interlaces,
randoms, etc.

Regroup and trip the set are defined by their centers and ends'
parts, so they are more general.

Couples/tandems of 3 and 4, and box/boxsome diamond/diamondsome
were added.  When you bring up the couples/tandem concepts submenu,
you really get your money's worth.  The "phantom" versions of these
concepts are no longer in the couples/tandem concepts submenu.
Click on the "phantom" concept before choosing the couples/tandem
concept if you want this effect.

It can do "riggers" in quarter-tag setups.  The "frontrigger" and
"backrigger" concepts were added for this.

"Slider" concept added.

16 matrix was added.  It now knows as much about 16 matrices as about
12 matrices.  Well, almost.

The concepts "4x4 matrix", "2x6 matrix", "2x8 matrix", and "16 matrix
of parallel diamonds" (well, what would YOU call it?) were added.
These enable one to declare the matrix when doing things like
"couples foursome", "boxsome", or "3x3".  Four example, from parallelogram
columns, "2x6 matrix 2x1 checkmate" will work, splitting it into 2x3's.
From normal two-faced lines, "2x8 matrix boxsome recycle" will create
extra boxes on the outside and do a wave-type recycle.  From normal waves,
"2x8 matrix tandem spin chain the line" works.

The internal restriction in the "mkcalls" program on the number of tagged
calls (1000) has been removed.  Most tables are allocated dynamically.
There are now no limits (within reason) on the database size, database
tag size, length of a sequence, or number of saved resolves, other than
the case of catastrophic failure of the operating system's memory
allocation mechanism.
