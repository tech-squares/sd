		    RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 25.6
       Database version = 25.3, format = 26, X11 UI version 1.10.

The beginnings of some user documentation has been written!!!
See the file sd_doc.txi .

Interlocked phantom box <--> line/column <--> diamond shape-changers
are implemented.

It is much more robust in the presence of phantoms for calls that have
star turns and centers cast 3/4 while the ends move up, such as chain
reaction and relay the top.

The fix to make spin chain thru illegal from lines back-to-back, alleged
in version 24, was finally done correctly.

Concepts that are illegal for the level are not used during "resolve"
or "do anything" operations.  The levels of concepts have been updated.

It now has a tiny glimmer of intelligence about what concepts not
to waste time with during "do anything" and "resolve" operations.
This glimmer is currently only noticeable at levels up through A2.

All the concentricity/elongation stuff has been completely reworked.
Again.  Sorry.  This should really work this time.  I think.  It can
now do "ENDS leads latch on" correctly from lines back-to-back and
"ENDS quarter right" correctly from a quarter-tag.

The built-in limits on total number of calls (previously 1000) and tagged
calls (previously 350) have been greatly improved.  There is no limit on
the total number of calls, and the built-in limit on the number of tagged
calls now exists only in the "mkcalls" program, and has been greatly
increased.  All memory allocation in sd itself is completely dynamic,
based on information that mkcalls encodes into the database file.

A bug was fixed that could lead to memory access violation if 40
concepts of the type that take two calls (e.g. checkpoint or centers
do this while ends do that) were nested.  Such a situation could
never lead to a legal call tree, and would not likely be entered
manually, but the resolver could in some cases (probability ~ 10**-25)
try to do such a thing.  (The bug was actually observed during stress
testing.)

A bug in the use of "longjmp" was fixed, that made the resolver not work
correctly when optimized on HP-UX, and perhaps other systems as well.

Flip the line and cross flip the line, and fractions thereof, are now legal
only from waves and two-faced lines, respectively.  Cross flip the line
is now the "CROSS" variation of flip the line, instead of being a separate
call.  The program will move the word "cross" into the correct place in the
call name.  Cross invert the column was changed in the same way.

Lockit is now legal from diamonds.
Counter rotate now works from 2x6, 2x8, 3x4, 4x4, and C1 phantom setups.
There are still some setups that it can't be done from.

The call "circulate" is now in the database in lower case.  It had previously
been in upper case to make it easier to find when window systems other
than X11 were used.

To get vertical dixie style, etc., select vertical [single file dixie style].

New calls: Zag zig, By golly, vertical <anything>, vertical turn and deal,
8 roll away with a half sashay.  The latter is a C4 call and is normally done
from a miniwave.  The mainstream call "roll away" is now legal only from a
couple.  The calls "wave the beaux" and "wave the belles" have been changed
to "wave the <anyone>".  Clear out is now done correctly.

Box the gnat was added.  It is equivalent to touch 1/2.  This is,
of course, not really right.  Don't call box the gnat followed by
hinge.


			User Interface Changes

The call menu has a title over it saying which menu you are looking at.

Mouse button 3 no longer does Undo by default.  It made the program
too unfriendly for novices.  The README file explains how to get this
behavior back.
