		   RELEASE NOTES FOR SD VERSION 30.8
		 Database version = 30.8 format = 51,
    X11 UI version 1.16, SDTTY UI version 1.6, MAC UI version 2.2.

****** Changes as of version 30.8 ******

New concepts: overlapped diamonds, overlapped lines, and overlapped waves.
Overlapped waves of course has an implicit "assume waves" in it.

Calls done correctly (I hope):
   straight away but [anything]
   quick [anything]
   stroll [anything]

New calls: explode the top, turning the star unusual amounts.

****** Changes as of version 30.79 ******

The way the "allow modifications" operation is specified was changed.
In all cases, there are still two levels of modifications --
"simple modifications" and "all modifications".  In the "sd" program,
you select them by clicking on the "simple modifications" or "allow
modifications" buttons, respectively.  In "sdtty", the respective commands
are the typed commands "simple modifications" and "allow modifications",
respectively.  That is, type "simple modifications" when you want things
like "trade percolate", and "allow modifications" when you want things
like "the axle but replace the cast 1/2 with a split trade circulate".

The "1/2" fraction can be given to calls for which there is an established
notion of doing the first half, even if there is no established notion of
doing the second half, for example, circulate, hinge, and zoom.  This
property works for compound calls as well, so "1/2 acey deucey" and
"1/2 deuces wild" now work naturally.

It is possible to do fractions of fractions in the case where the fraction
being applied to a subcall is 1/2.  That is, it is possible to give a fraction
to a call such that it causes N+1/2 parts of that call to be done.  This
means that things like "3/4, run wild" and "5/6, hot foot spin" are legal.

"Outlet" is a lot smarter.

Following a suggestion made some time ago by Eric Brosius, the resolver
performs an exhaustive search for one-call getouts before searching for
any getouts of two or more calls.

Resolves involving single file promenades have been made extremely rare.

The wording of fractional invert the column has been changed from "N/4 invert
the column" to "invert the column N/4".  You can also say just "invert the
column".  The same change was made to "exchange the boxes/diamonds N/4".

New calls:  [criss-cross] shadow the column, spin chain the star,
   [cross] trade your neighbor <direction>, splash <direction>.

****** Changes as of version 30.78 ******

You can type in calls such as "quarter thru" to sdtty either in words:
"quarter thru"/"three quarter thru", or as fractions: "1/4 thru"/"3/4 thru".
They will always print out in the transcript in words.  In the sd program,
they appear on the menu as "<N/4> thru", alphabetized under "t" for "thru".
A popup will appear asking for the number.

The "fractional" concept, as in "3/5 swing the fractions", is now
entered just as the fraction, for example, "3/5".  The word "(fractional)"
is no longer used.  To avoid ambiguity in the transcript, a comma will
be placed after the fraction, as in
         1/4, stable change the wave
not to be confused with
         1/4 stable change the wave

Furthermore, the concept formerly known as "do it twice" is now just
called "twice".  It, too, will have a comma after it in the transcript
to make the meaning more clear.

Furthermore, there is a concept "1-M/N", for any suitable fraction M/N,
that does the call once and a little more.  Typically this is 1-1/2 or so.

The concept formerly (as of version 30.74) known as "<so-and-so> ONLY"
is now just called "<so-and-so>".  It will be separated by a comma from
the following text in the transcript to avoid ambiguity.  When using sdtty,
YOU MUST TYPE IN THE COMMA.  This is to avoid ambiguity with such concepts
as "centers", which is different in very subtle ways, I think.
To have the other people do some other call, type in
"heads, (while the others)" with a comma after the people designator.
It will be printed in the transcript as "heads, hinge while the others trade".

There is now an extensive collection of "assume" concepts, such as
"assume waves" and "assume facing diamonds".  Furthermore, the concepts
"split phantom waves", "split phantom 1/4 tags", and the like are considered
to carry such concepts, unlike "split phantom lines" and "Split phantom
diamond spots".  See the section "assume waves" in the manual for more details.

A change was made in the database file format.  Unless you write your own database,
this will not affect you.  The qualifiers "n_is_1" etc., have been removed.  Instead
of "qualifier n_is_1", use "nqualifier 1 none".  The "nqualifier" keyword says that
a combined number test and qualifier are coming next.  The call definition clause will
only be acted upon if the qualifier is satisfied and the number matches.  The qualifier
"none" is always satisfied.

****** Changes as of version 30.77 ******

For users of the X11 window system (sd on Unix), the "parallelogram" concept
has been moved to the "distorted setup concepts" submenu, at the bottom of
the second column.

****** Changes as of version 30.76 ******

New person designators: "headliners" (the people currently facing the head walls)
and "sideliners" (the people currently facing the side walls).  These are not
used below C4, but if anyone succeeds in introducing their use at lower levels,
that will be fine with me.

Split dixie style (and similar things) are now done correctly much more
generally than before.

Exchange the diamonds 1/4 and 1/2, with people colliding, is now supported.

The wording of some calls has been changed.  "<N/4> exchange the diamonds/boxes"
is now "exchange the diamonds/boxes <N/4>".  [See also 30.79.]

An obscure bug in "quadruple boxes working together swing the fractions" was
fixed.  We thank Ross Howell for finding this, and apologize to the dancers.

****** Changes as of version 30.74 ******

Took out the words "end-to-end" for those versions of concepts like
triple lines or split phantom columns that place the setups end-to-end.
The program will just figure it out.  So will your dancers.

New concept: matrix.  The word "matrix" must precede the concept to which it
applies, as in "matrix split phantom lines".  Matrix may be used with the
usual phantom concepts, as well as with "split" and "each 1x4".  It may
also be used with "standard", as in "heads ARE STANDARD IN MATRIX SPLIT
PHANTOM LINES slim down".

New concepts: all 4 couples and all 8.  Inner dual boxes.

New concept: mirror.  This can apply to any call, and does a complete
mirror reversal of it, including the act of taking right hands if
dancers meet at the end.  That is, dancers will actually take left hands
in this case.  Calls modified by "left" or "reverse" do not have this
property -- dancers come to physical right hands.  Hence "left chain reaction"
only affects the hinge (if necessary), but "mirror chain reaction" also
causes dancers to come to left hands if they meet at the end of the call.
"Mirror left chain reaction" would of course use a right-handed hinge and
then come to left hands at the end.

New concepts: assume <whatever> for several values of <whatever>, such
as waves, two-faced lines, magic columns, facing lines, etc.  Also, there
is a concept "with active phantoms" that can be used after these.  Please
see the manual for a discussion of what these concepts mean.  The
implementation of these concepts is in a rather incomplete state at present.

New calls: [cross] kick by <n>.  Double/triple star thru.  Square thru
etc. to a wave.  Square thru but on the <Nth> hand (courtesy of Dave
Decot).  Drop in/out are now legal from facing diamonds.  Many
minor improvements.

"Bigblock" and "stagger" are now applicable to any kind of distorted
lines or columns respectively.  So "bigblock" is legal in a butterfly or "O".

It now prints a "line" number next to each call in the displayed sequence.
They will not appear in the printed transcript file.

It now prints the "1/2" correctly in things like "reflected [1/2 tag]" and
"[revert [1/2 flip]] motivate".  It used to take the "1/2" out, with
disastrous results, in the mistaken belief that these calls were like
"[flip] your neighbor".

The plural of "beau" is now spelled "beaus", in accordance with the
Callerlab C1 list (but not the C1 definitions!)

It now enforces the rules for the "stretch" concept: the call must be a
4-person call, split along the same axis as the stretching axis.

In general, "stretch", "central", and "crazy" work much better than formerly.

The "so-and-so do something" concepts have been extensively rewritten.
There are four related concepts:
    "<so-and-so> only"
    "<so-and-so> disconnected"
    "<so-and-so> do your part"
    "own the <so-and-so>"
Briefly, they mean the following:
    "<so-and-so> only" means that the designees work among themselves
         in whatever undistorted setups they can find.
    "<so-and-so> disconnected" means that the designees work in whatever
         setup they find after removing the non-designees.
    "<so-and-so> do your part" means that the designees work in the
         original setup, with the non-designees replaced by phantoms.
    "own the <so-and-so>" is like "do your part", except that strict
         matrix positioning is used.
Please read the section "so-and-so only" in the manual for details.
         [Superseded as of 30.78.]

Note that the prior inability to have, for example, the girls hinge from
a BGGBBGGB grand wave to make point-to-point diamonds, is now fixed.
It can be done in any of the following ways:
   each 1x4 centers hinge
   girls only hinge
   girls disconnected hinge

A warning is printed for non-interacting use of "multiple formations working",
"interlocked phantom setups", and "phantom setups" concepts.  That is,
things like "triple boxes working together scoot back", "grand working right
star thru", "interlocked phantom lines swing thru", and "phantom columns
double pass thru" give a warning.  The "resolve", "reconcile", and "pick
random call" operations will not choose calls that give this warning.
In the case of "interlocked phantom setups" and "phantom setups", you should
use "split phantom setups" instead.  I would have preferred to have the
required concept be "quadruple setups", but the "quadruple setups" concept
is generally C4, while some of the "phantom setups" and "interlocked phantom
setups" concepts are C3 or C3A.

The call "counter" is now more literate about the subtleties of "left",
"interlocked", and "cross".  "Central counter" is literate also.

The concept "once removed" is now legal in once removed diamonds.  The concept
"once removed diamonds" still exists.

In honor of Clark Baker, the concept "once removed" is now legal in
dog-bone setups and point-to-point diamonds.

It now recognizes a number of getouts from squared sets.

It now accepts certain combinations of stacked fractionalization concepts,
such as "REVERSE ORDER 2/3 (fractional) remake" or "DO THE LAST 2/3:
REVERSE ORDER remake", which are, of course, equivalent.  It can also
do RANDOM and PIECEWISE on fractionalized and/or reversed calls.
Also, if a call is executed "crazy" (or fractional crazy or reverse crazy)
the crazy concept provides the fractionalization.  Hence, it is permissible
to say things like "random stable crazy mix".  In such a case, the two parts
of the "mix" are irrelevant.  The "crazy mix" has 4 parts.

Note that
      1/4 stable random crazy
and
      random 1/4 stable crazy
are very different.

The "centers and ends/two calls in succession/undo/undo" bug was fixed.
You don't want to know.

The bug that allowed things like "ends circulate" or "team up" from a
starting DPT has been fixed.  Also, things like "ends flutter wheel" from
a starting DPT or from facing lines is now illegal.

The "allow modifications" icon only needs to be clicked on (or typed)
once to get the full range of modifications.  There are no longer two
levels of modifiability.  [Superseded as of 30.79.]

A few function keys have been defined for the PC.  Pressing the following
keys is equivalent to entering the indicated text.  Future versions of the
program will have the ability to have a customization file indicate what
keys are bound to what strings.
           f1 => "split phantom lines"
   shift   f1 => "interlocked phantom lines"
   control f1 => "phantom lines"
           f2 => "split phantom columns"
   shift   f2 => "interlocked phantom columns"
   control f2 => "phantom columns"
           f3 => "allow modifications"
           f4 => "<anything>"

The bug that made it crash if an extremely long line was typed to sdtty
has been fixed.  We thank Lynette Bellini's cat for finding this bug.

Before writing a sequence to the transcript file, it now checks to see whether
a control-Z character exists at the end of that file, and removes same.  Some
editors on PC's have been observed placing such characters at the end of a
file, and some printing software stops when it encounters a control-Z,
resulting in inability to print files containing sequences that were
appended after the file was edited.

There are new concepts: "PRECEDE IT BY" and "FOLLOW IT BY", which take
two calls.  They perform the first call (first in textual order, that is)
*before* or *after*, respectively, the second.  For example, "FOLLOW IT BY roll,
swing thru", does a swing thru and roll.  There is only one context in which
these concepts are sensible -- they can be the subject of the PIECEWISE,
RANDOM, or REVERSE RANDOM meta-concepts.  For example, "PIECEWISE FOLLOW IT
BY criss cross the deucey, turn the key" will do a criss cross the deucey
after each of the three parts of turn the key.  Please see the manual for
further discussion of the linguistic implications of these.

Please read the new section "linguistic idiosyncrasies" in the manual.
