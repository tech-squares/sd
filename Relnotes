		    RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 27.1

========================================================================
To remove from SRC's database:  3x3/4x4 peel/trail off, peel/trail the deal,
loop & tag.  Beau hop.  Turn to a line, turn and deal, triple turn,
circle to a wave, follow your leader.  Walk and dodge, bend the line,
crossfire, shake and/or rattle, wheel thru, wheel the ocean/sea
========================================================================




Finally fixed (????) stuff like "centers [2/3 recycle] the difference"
from a grand wave.  This also makes the evil example in the documentation
work.

Fixed another evil case of knowing where the phantoms went on things like
"split phantom lines tag chain thru reaction".

New MxN calls: various fractions of peel/trail off, peel/trail the deal,
including 3X3 and 4X4.  3X3 and 4X4 loop and tag, beau/belle hop, turn/wheel to a line,
turn/wheel and deal, triple turn/wheel, circle to a wave, follow your leader,
walk and dodge, couple up, bend/retreat the line, crossfire, shake and/or rattle,
wheel thru, wheel the ocean/sea.

The ability to expand the matrix from a 2x4 to a 2x6 or 2x8 when executing a
call that requires same was implemented.  It is now possible to do 12 matrix
circulate or 3X3/4X4 follow your leader from a 2x4.

Other new calls: Soft touch, about.

New concepts: Triple/quadruple lines/columns working together/apart.
These take a 1x12 or 1x16 setup.  Also, plain triple/quadruple
lines/columns can be done from a 1x12 or 1x16.

More new concepts: Fractional stable.  It can only do these for calls that
have had stability information encoded into the database, which most calls
do not yet have.  See below.

It can now do "matrix" calls (U-turn back, quarter left/right, press/truck where
appropriate) in more setups, including triple diamonds, quadruple diamonds,
3x1 diamonds, and 1x10/1x12/1x14/1x16.

Database internal stuff:
   The restriction in the database known as "peelable box" is now legal from
   3x2 and 4x2 columns, and means that, in each single file column, all people
   are facing the same way.  The meaning of "peelable box" in a 2x4, that the
   ends are in a peelable 2x2, was removed.  Use "ends_are_peelable" for this.
   Cast a shadow and criss-cross the shadow were modified accordingly.

   The new letters "Z", "C", and "A" are used to indicate stability in a
   by-array call specifier.  They appear just before the roll indicator,
   if any.  For example:
         array [AL0E CR1W AL0W CR1E]    (this is "bingo")
   "C" means this person turns 1 to 4 positions clockwise.  Exactly how
   far will be deduced from his ending direction.  "A" means he turns 1
   to 4 positions anticlockwise.  "Z" means he does not turn at all, but
   stability is still supported.  If no indicator is present, fractional
   stable is not supported for this person.  More complex indicators will
   be provided in the future for calls that have people reverse direction.

A bug in initialization was fixed that made it not think that "ladies chain"
was legal from facing lines.  What was the problem?  Ladies chain is only
legal from normal couples.  When setups were being tested at program startup,
the test setup for lines facing and 8 chain had the couples sashayed.
