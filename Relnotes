		    RELEASE NOTES FOR SD VERSION 29.2
       Database version = 29.1, format = 40, X11 UI version 1.14.


WARNING!  This is not a major release!  It is being distributed for
the purpose of testing the user interface changes.


Finally added the "magic_outroller_is_cw" predicate, so that magic outroll
circulate now works as well as magic inroll circulate.

New calls: [magic] in/out/zoom roll circulate from 2x3 setups.

There is a new command "toggle concept levels" that affects whether
concepts that are illegal at the current level will be presented.
This condition is normally off, meaning that off-level concepts
are not presented to the matcher in sdtty (i.e. they aren't recognized
when you type them, and aren't presented when you type "?").  In the
future, the X11 interface may also deactivate off-level concepts on
the menus.  Also, the "resolve", "reconcile", "do_anything", and
"nice_setup" commands will not generate off-level concepts.  When the
"concept levels" switch is on, all concepts are presented, and made
available to the resolver, regardless of their level, though a warning
will be printed on the sequence whenever an off-level concept is used.
The "toggle concept levels" command toggles the state of this switch.
It is an icon in the X11 version, and a typed command in sdtty.

USER INTERFACE CHANGES:

The program "sdtty" has been extensively rewritten for PC's and Unix
systems.  The PC behavior has not been tested; differences from the
previous version are difficult to characterize.  The Unix behavior
now uses the "curses" display access mechanism.  It should make
effective use of the screen-editing features of the terminal (VT-100
or emulation of same, or whatever) to keep the screen updated.

You should be able to turn off the use of insert/delete line
capabilities by giving the command-line switch "-no_line_delete" at
program startup.

You should be able to turn the "curses" mechanism off completely by giving
the command-line switch "-no_cursor" at program startup.  This should even
make it possible to use the program from a printing device.
