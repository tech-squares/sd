		    RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 27.6
       Database version = 27.7, format = 31, X11 UI version 1.11.

Finally fixed (????) stuff like "centers [2/3 recycle] the difference"
from a grand wave.  This also makes the evil example in the documentation,
[CHECKPOINT LEFT catch [SINGLE CONCENTRIC snake] 3 BY [2/3 recycle]
the difference] cover up, work.  I recently called that example to a
C4 group.  They got through it, but did not seem very happy about it.

Fixed a bug in the table directing the transformation of a 4x4 into
quadruple diamonds.  This would only occur if people were all in the outer
columns, and a concept like "quadruple diamonds" or "split phantom diamonds"
was used, which requires the people to consider themselves points of those
diamonds.  This would have resulted in an incorrect sequence.  We apologize
for any behind-the-microphone embarrassment that this may have caused.

Fixed another evil case of knowing where the phantoms went on things like
"split phantom lines tag chain thru reaction".

Tightened up the program's understanding or nonunderstanding of where
phantoms went.  It is no longer possible to call "split phantom lines
hocus pocus" from columns.  It used to do it wrong, by not leaving space
for the phantoms.  It now refuses, because it doesn't know which way the
phantoms oriented their setup, and hence it doesn't know whether to leave
room for them.  It is true that many humans would claim that this is legal,
and that one does have to leave room for the phantoms no matter which way
they are facing, due to the "double O circulate" theorem.  However, the
program does not know that theorem.

New MxN calls: various fractions of peel/trail off, peel/trail the deal,
including 3X3 and 4X4.  3X3 and 4X4 loop and tag, beau/belle hop, turn/wheel
to a line, turn/wheel and deal, triple turn/wheel, circle to a wave, follow
your leader, walk and dodge, couple up, bend/retreat the line, crossfire,
shake and/or rattle, wheel thru, wheel the ocean/sea.

The ability to expand the matrix from a 2x4 to a 2x6 or 2x8 when executing a
call that requires same was implemented.  It is now possible to do 12 matrix
circulate or 3X3/4X4 follow your leader from a 2x4.

Other new calls: Soft touch, about, diamond inlet/outlet/recycle, 3/4 wheel
the ocean/sea/to a diamond.  Magic versions of various 3x1 transfer things.
Lots of other minor maintenance.

New concepts: Triple/quadruple lines/columns working together/apart.
These take a 1x12 or 1x16 setup.  Also, plain triple/quadruple
lines/columns can be done from a 1x12 or 1x16.

More new concepts: Fractional stable and fractional twosome/solid.  It can
only do these for calls that have had stability information encoded into the
database, which most calls do not yet have.  See below.

It can now do "matrix" calls (U-turn back, quarter left/right, press/truck where
appropriate) in more setups, including triple diamonds, quadruple diamonds,
3x1 diamonds, and 1x10/1x12/1x14/1x16.

Database internal stuff:
   The restriction in the database known as "peelable box" is now legal from
   3x2 and 4x2 columns, and means that, in each single file column, all people
   are facing the same way.  The meaning of "peelable box" in a 2x4, that the
   ends are in a peelable 2x2, was removed.  Use "ends_are_peelable" for this.
   Cast a shadow and criss-cross the shadow were modified accordingly.

   A new restriction "all_facing_same" was added, that tests that all 4,
   6, or 8 people are facing the same way in a 2x2, 2x3, or 2x4.  This was
   used to make 3x3/4x4 leads wheel the ocean complain if not done from a
   "couple following a couple".

   A new restriction "nice_diamonds" was added, that tests that parallel
   or point-to-point diamonds are entirely consistently handed.  This
   forbids "diamond swing thru" from facing diamonds, which used to be
   accepted.

   The new letters "Z", "C", and "A" are used to indicate stability in a
   by-array call specifier.  They appear just before the roll indicator,
   if any.  For example:
         array [AL0E CR1W AL0W CR1E]    (this is "bingo")
   "C" means this person turns 1 to 4 positions clockwise.  Exactly how
   far will be deduced from his ending direction.  "A" means he turns 1
   to 4 positions anticlockwise.  "Z" means he does not turn at all, but
   stability is still supported.  If no indicator is present, fractional
   stable is not supported for this person.  More complex indicators will
   be provided in the future for calls that have people reverse direction.

   There is a new call flag "12_16_matrix_means_split" which means that,
   if this call is given with the 12 matrix concept in a 3x4 or 2x6 setup,
   it will do the call in each of the three 1x4's or 2x2's respectively
   if that is required.  It used to be that calls would do that in all
   cases, so that the initial trade in a 12 matrix relay the top
   would work.  It had the unfortunate consequence that, from triple
   lines "12 matrix counter rotate" was legal and would do a lockit in
   each of the 3 waves.  Now the call "trade" has this flag but "counter
   rotate" does not, so that "12 matrix relay the top" works but "12 matrix
   counter rotate" is illegal.  You can of course do a plain counter rotate.

A bug in initialization was fixed that made it not think that "ladies chain"
was legal from facing lines.  What was the problem?  Ladies chain is only
legal from normal couples.  When setups were being tested at program startup,
the test setup for lines facing and 8 chain had the couples sashayed.

The file sd_doc.txi was renamed sd_doc.txinfo.

Two new command line arguments:

-sequence filename          sets the base name for sequence output
-db filename                sets the calls database file

The defaults are as before.  There are X resources associated with both.


			User Interface Changes

Safety border around concept popups.

Prettier mouse cursor in some cases.

The file Sd.ad was renamed Sd.res, and the documentation of its use
has changed.  It is no longer considered an app-defaults file.  Most
users were unable to install it in /usr/lib anyway.  It is now merely
a sample of some resources you might want to set in your user
resources file for Sd.  See README for the new documentation.
