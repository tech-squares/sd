         Note that the second argument to "idlok" is defined in the documentation
         as being of type "bool", and must be given as TRUE or FALSE.  (The HP-UX
         documentation specifically says that you must use TRUE or FALSE, not 1 or 0,
         even though an examination of the file /usr/include/curses.h shows these
         constants defined as 1 and 0.)  Apparently the convention, used by
         C programmers throughout the rest of the known universe, that boolean
         conditions are expressed as integers, with zero denoting falsehood and
         any nonzero value denoting truth, wasn't good enough for the designers
         of "curses", so they added a new data type and constants just for us.
         In choosing the names of the type and the constants, they also seem to
         have felt secure in the assumption that *NO ONE ELSE*, either end-user or
         another subsystem designer, would ever conceivably want to use such obscure
         names as "bool", "TRUE", and "FALSE".

         Note that, in the spirit of encapsulation, we use a conditional
         expression to turn our ordinary 1/0 condition into the required
         TRUE/FALSE values.  We have no choice, since we aren't really allowed
         to look at the include file.  We rest assured and confident that the
         compiler will not be confused by this and will generate optimal code.
         Right? */

/*******************************************************
    WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

We are about to call the curses service known as "getyx".
This service VIOLATES REFERENTIAL TRANSPARENCY!!!  That
is, it violates the principle that, if you don't see a
variable on the left-hand side of an assignment, or with
an ampersand in front of it, you KNOW FOR CERTAIN that
that variable isn't modified.  The ability to know, simply
by looking at a program, what variables get clobbered, or
what other side-effects might occur, is, of course, an
extremely important aspect of good programming, as any
programmer with a multi-cellular brain can tell you.

In fact, more generally, it is critically important to
be able to tell, straightforwardly and trivially, what a
program will do simply by looking at it.  This property is
known as the "WYSIWYG" ("what you see is what you get")
property of programming languages.  (This is not to be
confused with the WYSIWYG property of editors or the
WYSIWYG property of text formatters, which are also very
desirable properties but unrelated to the WYSIWYG property
of programming languages.)

A common way that programming languages can fail to obey
the WYSIWYG property is to provide a method for cloaking
the true linguistic text of the program by means of a
text transformation mechanism such as a macro processor.
Real programmers, needless to say, NEVER use macro
processors for this purpose, even if doing so might make
the program more "convenient" to write.  (The purpose
of a program is not to be convenient to write.  The purpose
is to behave correctly, and obeying the WYSIWYG property
is the single most important thing that a program can do
in furtherance of this goal.)

The manner in which the "getyx" service violates the
WYSIWYG property is, not surprisingly, through a macro.
Someone thought that typing two ampersands was too much
trouble, and that he or she could make the use of this
service more "convenient" by making it a macro that clobbers
the variables named in the macro call.

Furthermore, even the convention that macros will always
be in upper case, a convention that most C programmers
adhere to in recognition of the extremely dangerous
nature of macros, isn't adhered to in this case.

Some operating system vendors' manuals actually describe
this situation as though they think it is a good thing.

For example, the HP-UX manual says

     "This is a macro, so no ampersand is necessary"

        [What does "not necessary" mean in the context
        of programming system documentation?  Is it
        optional?  Is it forbidden?  Furthermore, what
        is the significance of the "so" conjunction in
        that sentence?  Does it logically follow from
        the fact that something is a macro that ampersands
        are never necessary?  Am I missing something?]

and the AT&T System V Release 4 manual says

     "Note that all of these interfaces [getyx and
     several others] are macros and that "&" is not
     necessary before the variables y and x"

and the SunOS 4.1 manual says

     "This is implemented as a macro, so no "&" is
     necessary before the variables"

whereas the correct way to document this would have been

     "This is a macro, and, to save you the two seconds
     that it would take to type two ampersands, we have
     violated referential transparency in it.  To further
     confuse you, we have put it in lower case.  After
     you finish rewriting whatever static analysis tools
     you use at your place of employment so that they
     won't be fooled by the apparent right-hand-side
     usage of what might appear to be an uninitialized
     variable, please make good use of whatever time
     remains of the two seconds that we have saved you."
