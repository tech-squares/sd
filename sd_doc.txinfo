@node Getting Started, The Completing Reader for Sdtty, Intro, Top
@chapter Getting Started

@code{Sd} or @code{Sdtty} can be run from a shell (on Unix or DOS) by typing its name
and the level you want to write sequences for, e.g.,

@example
sd c2
@end example

or

@example
sdtty c2
@end example

The Macintosh version of @code{sd} is typically run by double clicking
on the application icon, which looks like the square dance symbol (two
overlapping squares).  An information window is displayed at startup;
this window can be dismissed by clicking anywhere on it with the mouse.

In addition to calls and concepts, there are program commands for actions
such as automatic resolves, exiting the program, and other miscellaneous
actions.  @xref{Resolving and Searching}.
In @code{sd}, they are found in the menu in the upper
left corner (or in pull-down menus on the Macintosh version).
In @code{sdtty}, just type the name of the command.

With some experimentation, you should be able to use the program without
reading this document.  The following chapters cover using @code{Sd} and
@code{sdtty} in detail.

@node The Completing Reader for Sdtty, Invoking Sd, Getting Started, Top
@chapter The Completing Reader for Sdtty

@code{Sdtty} uses a "completing reader" for interpreting the characters that you type.
This means that you only need to type as much of the word or command as is
required to be unambiguous.  Whenever you type a space, @code{sdtty} completes
the word you just typed, if necessary and possible.  Whenever you type
@key{<RET>} (or @key{<ENTER>}), @code{sdtty} completes the entire line
if necessary and possible.

For example, at mainstream, you can enter a swing thru by typing
@samp{swing thru <RET>}.  When the space aftter @samp{swing} is typed,
no completion is required.  When the @samp{<RET>} after @samp{thru} is typed,
no completion is required either.  If you type @samp{sw thru <RET>} instead,
@code{sdtty} completes the word @samp{swing}.  It does this by printing
@samp{ing} on the screen as soon as you type the space after
@samp{sw}.  If you type @samp{sw th <RET>},
@code{sdtty} will complete both words.  It prints @samp{ing} as soon as you type the
space, and it prints @samp{ru} as soon as you type the return.  In fact, you
could just type @samp{sw <RET>}.  @code{Sdtty} completes the entire line, if necessary
and possible, when return is typed. so it will print @samp{ing thru} after
your @samp{sw}.  In each case, the full phrase @samp{swing thru} will appear
on the screen, and will be printed in the final sequence.

Because of this completion, you can get into the habit of just typing @samp{sw <RET>}
at mainstream.  However, it will only work if what you type is unambiguous.
At higher levels, @samp{sw} could also mean @samp{swap around}.  When there is an
ambiguity, @code{sdtty} will beep at you and complete as much as it can.  You can
type @kbd{?} (discussed below) to see what the problem is.

With practice, you can get a reasonable feel for how much abbreviation you can
get away with in a given context.

Typing @code{<ESCAPE>} (or @code{<ALT MODE>} on some keyboards) or @code{<TAB>} will
complete the entire line, just like @code{<RET>}, but will not actually process
the line.  If you like what you see, you can then press @code{<RET>} to execute
the call.

At any time, you can type a question mark.  This will make @code{sdtty} print out
all legal completions of the line that has been entered so far.  If what you
have typed is unambiguous, that will consist of just one thing.  If you
have typed nothing, it will consist of every legal thing you could type---typically
that is every call, every concept, and every special command.

The output from typing a question mark may be quite lengthy.  If it fills
more than one screenful, @code{sdtty} will stop and display @samp{--More--} at the
bottom of the screen.  Type a space to go on to the next screenful.  Type
@code{<RET>} to see just one more line.  Type a backspace (or @code{<DEL>})
to stop.  When the output ends, either because @code{sdtty} printed everything or
because you typed a backspace, the partially entered line will be redisplayed, just
as it was before you typed the question mark.

@code{Sdtty}'s completing reader is completely indifferent to the capitalization of
what you type.  It caplitalizes its output according to its own notions of
esthetics and ambiguity avoidance.

Note: This chapter does not apply to the Macintosh version.
@xref{Macintosh Overview}.

The program is normally invoked with a single argument---the level.
This is one of the following: @code{m} (mainstream), @code{p} (plus),
@code{a1}, @code{a2}, @code{c1}, @code{c2}, @code{c3a},
@code{c3}, @code{c3x}, @code{c4a}, or @code{c4}.
The default is @code{m}.
This determines the calls and concepts that will be made
available, according to our best guess of what the levels mean.  Various
optional arguments are permitted to control the window system, 
customize the list of calls used, and set other options.
These will be described later.

The call definitions will be read in from the encoded database file
@file{sd_calls.dat}.  The program will then ponder the database for a few
seconds while it determines what calls to put on what menus.  Depending
on the speed of your computer and the level you selected, this could take
from a few seconds to over a minute.

@node Command-Line Options, Abridgement,  , Invoking Sd
@section Command-Line Options

Options used by both @code{sd} and @code{sdtty}:

@table @code
@item -db @var{filename}
location of the calls database.  The default is @file{sd_calls.dat} in
the current directory.
@item -sequence @var{filename}
base name of the file to write sequences to.  The calling level will be
appended to this name.  The default is @file{sequence}, so a complete
file name might be @file{sequence.C1}.
@end table

There are X resources associated with both options:
@code{Sd.sequenceFile} is equivalent to the @w{@code{-sequence}} switch, and
@code{Sd.databaseFile} is equivalent to @code{-db}.

If you almost always will be passing the the same value for a
command-line switch, you may find it more convenient to set the
corresponding resource.

With the X Window System interface, Sd accepts all Xt command-line
options.  The following are some of the more useful options for use with
Sd.

@table @code
@item -rv
reverse video
@item -bg @i{color}
background color
@item -fg @i{color}
foreground color
@item -bd @i{color}
border color
@item -font @i{font}
font used everywhere
@item -geometry @i{geom-spec}
geometry in pixels
@item -title @i{string}
title for window manager and icon use
@item -name @i{string}
name to look up resources under.  default: program name.
@item -xrm @i{resource-line}
an X resource manager string.
@end table

These options are specific to the terminal-based version, @code{sdtty}.

@table @code
@item -no_cursor
dumb terminal mode: do not use cursor motion commands to keep the screen
up-to-date efficiently.  Use this if the cursor motion adn screen manipulation
operations of your terminal or operating system are not available or are not
working satisfactorily.
@item -lines @var{nlines}
the number of lines on the screen.  Default is 25.
@item -no_line_delete
do not use the insert line or delete line cursor control commands.  Use this
if these commands are not working satisfactorily on your terminal.
@end table


@node Abridgement,  , Command-Line Options, Invoking Sd
@subsection Abridgement

The program recognizes three flags which allow use of an abridged
list of calls:

@table @code
@item -write_list @var{filename}
write out the call list for the indicated level and exit
@item -write_full_list @var{filename}
write out the call list for the indicated level and all lower levels
and then exit the program.
@item -abridge @var{filename}
read in the file, strike all the calls contained therein off the menus,
and proceed.
@end table

The first two are used to prepare a call list.  The call list for the
indicated level, exactly as the calls appear in the menu, will be written
to the named file.  If @code{-write_list} is used, only the calls exactly on
that level will be written.  If @code{-write_full_list} is used, the lower level
calls will be written as well, so the file will look exactly like the
main call menu.  After performing either of these operations, the program
exits.

The third special flag is used to read in a list of calls to be avoided.
Any call listed in the file, in precisely the same format as it was written
out, will be removed from the internal database prior to running the program.
Every sequence written under control of such a file will say @samp{(abridged)}
on its header line.

To write sequences for a group that is learning C2, for example, run the
program with
@example
        sd c2 -write_list my_group
@end example

Then delete from the file @file{my_group} those calls that the group has
learned, i.e., those calls not to be avoided.
When writing sequences, use the command
@example
        sd c2 -abridge my_group
@end example

As the group learns new C2 calls, delete the corresponding lines from
the file @file{my_group}.  That file always contains the calls that they don't
yet know.  When the file goes to zero, they know the whole list.

Be aware that the abridgement mechanism works only for calls, not for concepts.
You must keep track of what concepts not to use.

The lines in the abridgement file must always be in exactly the same format
as the strings that are written out by the @code{-write_list} or @code{-write_full_list}
flags.  The program has no tolerance for creative capitalization, stray
blanks, or other variations.  Any line in the file that does not match a
call in the menu is simply ignored.  The order of the lines is not important.

@section The Startup Screen

The startup menu is displayed when the program starts and after each
sequence has been completed and written to a file.  In addition to the
obvious program exit button, this permits you to select the starting
operation.  The selections here, and almost everywhere else in the
program, are made by moving the mouse until the cursor is over the
chosen item, and pressing Mouse Button 1 (typically the left button).

If you are using the Macintosh version of @code{sd}, the startup screen
displays a set of buttons in the input pane of the sequence window.
These buttons correspond to the startup menu commands described in this
chapter.

@menu
* Heads/Sides Start::           starting with the heads or sides
* 1P2P Lines::                  starting with 1P2P lines
* Just As They Are::            starting with a squared set
@end menu

@node Heads/Sides Start, 1P2P Lines,  , Startup Screen
@subsection Heads/Sides Start

If you click on @code{heads start} or @code{sides start}, the sequence will begin
with @samp{heads} or @samp{sides} and the first call.  Normally this means that the
designated people will move into the center and do the first call while
the others wait.  Subsequent calls will be directed to everyone.  For
example, one might click on @code{heads start}, and then @code{star thru}, and
then @code{double pass thru}, and so on.  You can also click on @code{heads start}
or @code{sides start} followed by a call such as @i{split square thru} or @i{split
dixie style to a wave}.  Use the @code{split} concept to get these.

If you want to have the heads go into the middle and do several calls
before the sides join in, as in @i{head ladies chain ; heads square thru 4},
or @i{heads touch 1/4 ; walk and dodge}, you must click on @code{centers}
before all calls after the initial one.  Typically, you won't need to read
the card that way, but can rely on precise phrasing and inflection of your
voice to express what you want.

@node 1P2P Lines, Just As They Are, Heads/Sides Start, Startup Screen
@subsection 1P2P Lines

The @code{heads 1P2P} and @code{sides 1P2P} starting actions refer to caller jargon
for a common starting maneuver, typified by @i{so-and-so lead right and
circle up 4}.  You can read the card that way, or as @i{wheel thru and
circle up 4}, or as @i{step right}, or as @i{bring us together}, or whatever
improvisation you like.  The promenade distance printed at the end of the
sequence will assume that you said @i{step right} or @i{lead right @r{(or @i{wheel
thru})} and circle up 4}.

Whether you consider 1P2P openings to be overused is up to you.

@node Just As They Are,  , 1P2P Lines, Startup Screen
@subsection Just As They Are

The @code{just as they are} button starts the sequence on squared set spots,
without having the heads or sides begin.  This is nearly useless, since
the program doesn't know about the @i{all 4 couples} concept or about
thars or alamo rings.  This shortcoming may be fixed in the future.

In the Macintosh version, this button is labelled @code{Squared Set}.

@node Entering Calls, Entering Concepts, Startup Screen, Calling
@section Entering Calls

The usual thing you do when writing a sequence is to select calls from
the call menu, perhaps preceded by one or more concepts.  (Concepts are
discussed in the next section.)  In @code{sd}, a call is selected by clicking
on the desired menu item.  In @code{sdtty}, a call is selected by typing
its name, followed by a @key{Return}.  The completing reader
(@xref{The Completing Reader for Sdtty}) lets you abbreviate calls.

A number of calls have limitations or quirks that you should be aware of.
@xref{Call Notes}.

@end menu

@node Call Variations, Call Menus,  , Entering Calls
@subsection Call Variations

There are a number of issues that make call entry less than completely
straightforward.  These have to do with variations that calls have---directions
(as in @code{quarter left}), numbers (as in @code{square thru 3} or @code{three quarter
thru}), person designators (as in @code{sides kickoff}), subcalls (as in @code{clover
and quarter thru} or @code{vertical tag your neighbor} or @code{shuttle rally} or
@code{in roll motivate}), and modifiers (as in @code{strut left} or @code{trans cross
chain reaction}).

To list all possible variations in the menus would be unweildy for a variety
of reasons.  Because of this, various methods are used to shorten the menus
and to allow the user to specify the desired variation.  These methods will
be discussed in detail presently, but in most cases what happens is the following:

In @code{sd}, the menus list only the base calls with special keywords
as in @code{quarter <DIRECTION>} or @code{square thru <N>}.  When you
click on such a menu item, a popup menu appears listing the possible choices.

In @code{sdtty}, the "menu" (that is, what you see if you type a question
mark) also has keywords.  You can type the item just as shown, e.g.
@code{quarter <DIRECTION>} or @code{square thru <N>} (you would actually type the
angle brackets) and then answer the question that @code{sdtty} asks.  But there is
an easier way---you can type what you want directly.  That is, just type
@code{quarter left} or @code{square thru 3}.  If you want to see the choices,
type @code{quarter <DIRECTION>} or whatever, and then type a question mark.

@table @code
@item Directions
Calls that take a direction have the keyword @code{<DIRECTION>} in them in the
menus, like @code{pass <DIRECTION>} or @code{spin a windmill, outsides <DIRECTION>}.

When using @code{sd}, after you click on such a call, a popup will appear listing
all possible directions.  Click on the one you want.  If you decide you don't
want that call, just move the mouse away from the popup.  (On the Macintosh, click
the @code{Cancel} button.)

When using @code{sdtty}, you can either type @code{pass <DIRECTION>} literally,
and then answer the question that the program will ask, or just type the actual call,
for example, @code{pass in}.

The menu lists all possible directions, including some that may not be possible
in the given context.

@item Numbers
Calls that take a number have the keyword @code{<N>}, @code{<N/4>}, or @code{<Nth>}
in them, like @code{eight chain <N>}, @code{invert the column <N/4>}, or
@code{square thru, but on the <Nth> hand <ANYTHING>}.

When using @code{sd}, a popup will appear listing the numbers from 1 to 8.  Click
on the one you want.  If the keyword was @code{<N/4>}, click on the value of @code{N}.
The program will turn it into @code{N/4} (or, if @code{N}=2, into @code{1/2}).
If you decide you don't
want that call, just move the mouse away from the popup.  (On the Macintosh, click
the @code{Cancel} button.)

When using @code{sdtty}, you can either type the keyword literally,
and then answer the question, or just type the number just as you want it to
appear in the call.  That is, you can type @code{invert the column <N/4>} and then
@code{3}, or @code{invert the column 3/4}.  You can type @code{1/2} or
@code{2/4}---the program will print it as @code{1/2} in all cases.  For @code{square
thru but on the <Nth> hand}, you can type the number in @code{Nth} form,
as in @code{square thru but on the 3rd hand}.  Of course, if you just type @code{3},
the completing reader will finish it for you.

Not all values of @code{N} will be meaningful for all calls.  For example, you
can @code{eight chain 5}, but you can't @code{invert the column 5/4}.

Some calls have the words @code{quarter}, @code{half}, or @code{three quarter}
in their names.  Examples are @code{quarter thru}, @code{quarter the deucey},
@code{quarter mix}, @code{quarter the alter}, and @code{quarter chain and circulate in}.
These are listed in the Callerlab lists with the words spelled out, though
individual preferences vary.  Some people prefer to write @code{1/4 thru} and
@code{3/4 thru}.  @code{Sd} and @code{sdtty} list the call as @code{<N/4> thru}
in the menu.  In @code{sd}, you click on that and then click on a number (only 1 and 3
are legal, of course).  In @code{sdtty}, you can type @code{<N/4> thru} and then type
1 or 3, or you can type the call directly, either in numbers or in words.  That is,
you can type either @code{1/4 thru} or @code{quarter thru}.  No matter how you
enter one of these calls, it will always be printed out in words, as in
@code{three quarter thru} or @code{half chain and circulate in}.

@item Person designators
These work like the others in a straightforward way.  The calls appear in the menu
with the @code{<ANYONE>} keyword, as in @code{patch the <ANYONE>}.  In @code{sd},
you click on that and then make a selection from a popup menu.  In @code{sdtty},
you can either type the @code{<ANYONE>} literally and then answer the question,
or you can type in the desired call directly, as in @code{patch the sides}.

The gender designators are @code{boys} and @code{girls}.  This is the way they
appear in the Callerlab mainstream list.  The author does not take a position
on whether the adult terms would be more reasonable words to use in any given context.
You must use your own judgement in deciding what to say.

Not all designators are legal in all cases, such as @code{leads run} from a grand
wave.

The program specifically refuses to recognize the meaning of the designators @code{centers}
and @code{ends} while in a 1x8 setup (e.g. a grand wave).  This is because these terms
can be ambiguous in such a setup.  If you want the centers of each 1x4, you must use
the @code{EACH 1X4}, @code{EACH LINE}, or @code{EACH WAVE} concept in order to make the
@code{centers} or @code{ends} designators work.  Of course, in many cases, other designators,
such as @code{boys} or @code{girls} can identify the same people unambiguously.
If you want to designate the 4 people in the center of the set, use @code{center 4}.
@code{Outer pairs} specifies the others.

@item Tagging Calls
Calls that use tagging calls have the keyword @code{<ATC>} (for Any Tagging Call) in
them, as in @code{<ATC> your neighbor} or @code{<ATC> chain thru and scatter reaction}.
Specify these in the usual way.  In @code{sdtty} you can type the @code{<ATC>} directly
or you can enter the complete call.

At C3 and above, the tagging calls include the calls @code{revert <ATC>} and
@code{reflected <ATC>} that make use of another tagging call.  In @code{sd}, you
will be presented with another popup.  In @code{sdtty}, you can type in the
entire call directly, as in @code{revert cross flip chain thru reactivate}.

@item Subcalls
Mandatory subcalls appear in the menu as the keyword @code{<ANYTHING>}, as
in @code{clover and <ANYTHING>}.  The handling of these in @code{sdtty} is not as
nice as for the keywords discussed previously.  It is not possible to type in the call
just the way you want it to appear.  @i{You must literally type the <ANYTHING>}.
That is, you type @code{clover and <ANYTHING>}.  Of course, because of the completing
reader, you rarely need to type that much.  Just @code{clover a} is enough, for
example.  In @code{sd}, click on the menu item in the usual way.  Either way,
the program will prompt you for a subcall.  This can be any legal call, including
concepts and modifiers.  Whatever you enter will appear in brackets, as in
@code{clover and [TANDEM shazam]}.
These mandatory subcalls, with the keyword @code{<ANYTHING>} in the menu,
are just one of many types of modifications.  @xref{Call Modifications},
for others.

@item cross, left, magic, and interlocked concepts
Some calls can use these concepts, but have the words appear in the call in a
tricky way.  You can always enter the concept followed by the call in the usual
way.  For example, in @code{sd}, you can click on @code{left} followed by
@code{chase right}.  In @code{sdtty}, you can type in @code{left} and then
@code{chase right}, on two separate lines.

In addition, @code{sdtty} allows more natural text entry.  You can type in
@code{chase left} directly.

No matter how you entered it, the calls will be printed out with the words
in the correct place.

Other examples of this phenomenon are
@example
   @code{switch to a magic diamond}
   @code{unwrap the interlocked diamonds}
   @code{hang a left}
   @code{scoot and cross ramble}
   @code{trans cross reactivate}
   @code{revert cross flip chain thru cross nuclear reaction}
@end example

The foregoing only applies to calls in which the word is an actual concept
or modifier.  Some calls happen to have the word @code{cross} as part of
their names.  Examples are:  @code{cross and wheel}, @code{cross and turn},
@code{cross your neighbor}, and @code{crossfire}.  Such calls appear in the
menu just as they are spelled.  Also, this only applies to cases in which the
word order is actually transformed.  To get @code{magic diamond circulate},
you must enter @code{magic} and then @code{diamond circulate} separately,
because no transformation of word order takes place.
@end table

@node Call Menus, Scrolling, Call Variations, Entering Calls
@subsection Call Menus

In @code{sd}, the call menu is the long menu near the center of the screen.  There are
actually 17 menus that can appear here, each tailored to the current
setup.  For example, if the current setup is right-hand waves, a menu
will appear that contains only those calls that the program believes
might be legal from right-hand waves.  This determination is approximate
but conservative---appearance on the menu does not necessarily mean it
is legal, though absence from the menu means that the program is fairly
certain that it can't be legal.  There is a @dfn{universal} menu that
appears when the setup is not one of the common ones, or when anything
complex is going on.  This contains every call that is in the database
for the chosen level.

The call menus are alphabetized in a way that ignores blanks and hyphens.
Special keywords such as @code{<N>}, @code{<ANYONE>}, @code{<DIRECTION>},
or @code{<ANYTHING>} are listed before letters.
Hence, @code{<ANYONE> run} and @code{<ATC> your neighbor}
will be found near the beginning of the menu.

If you are using the Macintosh version of @code{sd}, the call menu
is displayed as a utility window.  Calls are selected by double
clicking.  In addition, calls can be entered by typing their name,
as described in the next paragraph.

@node Scrolling,  , Call Menus, Entering Calls
@subsection Scrolling

The call menu can be scrolled with the scroll bar to its left.  Move the
mouse into the scroll bar area.  Clicking the left mouse button will scroll
the window down over the menu by a percentage of the window's size that is
equal to the percentage that the cursor is down from the top of the scroll
bar.  Clicking the right mouse button will scroll the window up by the
same amount.  Clicking the middle mouse button will move the window to a
percentage down the menu that is equal to the percentage that the cursor
is down from the top of the scroll bar.  If the mouse is moved while the
middle mouse button is held down, the menu will scroll in real time.

If you are using the Macintosh version of @code{sd}, the call window
can be scrolled using the scroll bar at the right of the window.

@node Entering Concepts, Call Modifications, Entering Calls, Calling
@section Entering Concepts

A call may be preceded by concepts, which modify the action of the call.
These may be nested (@dfn{stacked}) to any reasonable depth.

In @code{sdtty}, just type the concept you want.  The completing reader will
operate in the usual way.  @i{You must type a <RET> after each concept,}
even though the concept and the call that it modifies will appear
on the same line in the finished text.

In @code{sd}, click on the concept from a menu.  In a
perhaps hopeless attempt to keep the concept menus from becoming too
unwieldy, concepts have been organized into a general concept menu and
several submenus organized by topics.  The main concept menu is in the
lower left corner.  It supposedly contains all the extremely common
concepts.  Buttons for the other concepts submenus appear above this
menu.  Clicking on one of these buttons brings up the submenu.  If you
don't see what you want on a concept submenu, move the mouse away.  Some
concepts appear in more than one submenu---it doesn't matter which one
you use.  The submenus are listed below.  With practice, you will know
which submenu to use.

@table @code
@item phantom line/col concepts
those that involve picking out virtual setups, that may include
phantoms, from a real formation that is larger than eight people.
Examples: @i{split phantom lines}, @i{triple lines working forward}.

@item phantom box/dmd/qtag concepts
The same, for boxes, diamonds, and generalized quarter-tags.
Examples: @i{triple boxes}, @i{quadruple diamonds}, @i{triple
1/4 tags working together}.

@item couples/tandem concepts
the obvious thing.

@item distorted setup concepts
those that involve picking out distorted virtual setups, without
phantoms, by identifying real people out of a formation that is larger
than eight people, or the phantom equivalent of same.  Examples:
@i{parallelogram}, @i{stairstep lines}, @i{bigblock}.

@item 4-person distorted concepts
those that involve picking out 4-person virtual setups, without
phantoms, by identifying real people, or the phantom equivalent of same.
Examples: @i{trapezoid}, @i{once removed}, @i{jay}.

@item miscellaneous concepts
all others.  There are a lot of them.
@end table

When you click on any concept, the universal call menu replaces whatever
special call menu may have been presented, since the set of legal calls
becomes highly unpredictable.

If you are using the Macintosh version of @code{sd}, concepts are
displayed in the call window, following the calls.

Some concepts require a numeric designator (e.g., @code{interrupt after the 3rd
part}) or a people designator (e.g., @code{girls are stable}).  The handling
is the same as for calls that require these.

Some concepts require two calls (e.g., @code{checkpoint} and @code{interlace}).  After
choosing such a concept, enter the first call, preceded by whatever concepts
apply to it.  The program will then prompt you for the second call.
A complex tree of concepts and calls can thus be constructed.

The program recognizes the level at which concepts are legal, but lets you
override this if you wish.  The @code{toggle concept levels} command toggles
(turns on or off) the state of off-level concept permission.
@xref{Changing Modes}.
In the Macintosh program, use the @code{Allow Any Concept} command in the
@code{Sequence} menu to enable or disable off-level concepts.
When off-level concepts are enabled,
their use will cause a warning to be inserted into the transcript.

@node Call Modifications, Asymmetric Selectors, Entering Concepts, Calling
@section Call Modifications

Some calls can be modified in a natural way, such as @samp{in roll motivate}
and @samp{vertical tag your neighbor}, or in unnatural ways, such as @samp{trade
the diamond but replace the diamond circulate with explode the diamond}.
To form such a call, you must first enable call modifications
by clicking on @code{simple modifications} or @code{allow modifications}
before choosing the call.

There are two levels of this feature.  If you click on @code{simple
modifications}, you get the simple version, which only prompts
you for @dfn{natural} modifications.  Natural modifications have been somewhat
arbitrarily defined as those for which there is an accepted way of fitting
the words in without using the phrase ``but replace the <whatever> with
<whatever>.''  If you click on @code{allow modifications}, you allow
a potentially large number of modification possibilities, sometimes several
in the same call.

In most cases, @code{simple modifications} is probably the right thing.

If you are using the Macintosh version, call modification is enabled
using the @code{Modify Next Call} submenu of the @code{Sequence} menu.
Three commands are provided, which either disable call modification,
enable simple modifications, or enable all modifications.

When either level of modifications is selected, the line at the top of
the text transcript area indicates this.  Also, the universal call menu
is chosen whenever modifications are enabled, since the possibilities are
unpredictable.

When you click on a call for which modifications are possible, a popup
will appear saying something like @code{The box circulate can be
replaced.  Do you want to replace it?}  If you want to replace the
designated call, click in the active area of the popup; otherwise, move
the mouse away.  (On the Macintosh, click either the @code{Replace} or
the @code{Don't Replace} button.)  If you indicate that you want to
replace the call, you will then be prompted for the replacement call.
Enter it, along with any concepts.  In some cases you may be asked
repeatedly about various modifications.  For example, in @i{motivate},
you can replace the initial @i{circulate}, and you can turn the star a
different amount.  You may select any or all of these modifications.

Note:  When complex modifications are involved, the program may ask for them
in an order that seems unnatural.  This is because it asks in the order that
it executes the call internally, which may not be the same as the order in which
the words are spoken.  Do not be alarmed.  Observe the popup titles and
prompts carefully.  The final result should come out in the correct order.

For both these optional modifications and the mandatory subcalls discussed
earlier (e.g., @code{clover and <anything>}), the program attempts to show
unambiguously how everything is structured, by putting subcalls and their
accompanying concepts in square brackets.  It also attempts to put
natural modifications in their natural place in the phrase.  In complex
cases, like @samp{[CHECKPOINT LEFT catch [SINGLE CONCENTRIC snake] 3 BY
[2/3 recycle] the difference] cover up} things may be quite difficult.
How (and whether) you choose to read such a card is up to you.

@node Asymmetric Selectors,  , Call Modifications, Calling
@section Asymmetric Selectors

The people selector popup contains various asymmetric selectors such as
@code{near line} and @code{far box}.  You can use these selectors with
the @code{so-and-so do your part} concept to call @i{near column
pass thru}, etc.  The resultant setup must be reasonable---shape-changers
on one side of the set may lead to problems.
Most calls have not been checked for
robustness in the presence of asymmetrical setups.  Use this with care!
The resolver checks all eight people, so it should work.
If you have not restored symmetry, resolves may be extraordinarily difficult
to find.

@node Resolving, Normalize,  , Resolving and Searching
@section Resolving

Whenever the setup is in a resolved state, whether intentionally or
accidentally, the program indicates that fact at the bottom of the
transcript area.
The program looks for @i{right and left grand}, @i{left allemande},
@i{promenade}, @i{single file promenade}, and @i{circle left/right}
getouts from a variety of setups.  If the sequence needs an
@i{extend}, @i{slip the clutch}, @i{circulate}, @i{pass thru}, @i{trade by},
@i{cross by}, or @i{dixie grand}
first, the program reports that too.

Whenever the @samp{resolve} message appears, you can end the sequence and
write it to a file by selecting @code{end this sequence}.
In @code{sd}, the button for this is in the group in the upper left
portion of the screen.  In @code{sdtty}, simply type the command, with
the usual completion mechanism.
If you are using the Macintosh version, you can save the sequence to
a file at any time, whether or not it is resolved, using the @code{Save}
or @code{Save As} commands.

There are
at least three ways to resolve a sequence: you can wander into a resolve
by accident, you can @dfn{sight resolve} the square, entering the calls
that you want, or you can use the @code{resolve} command.  This command
adds the necessary calls to the sequence, exactly as if you had entered
them.

When you select @code{resolve}, the program goes into a special mode in
which it searches for resolutions, saves them, and lets you look through
them and pick one that you like.
A resolution is a sequence of up to three calls
that leads to a resolved state.  While the program is in resolve mode,
the call menu is replaced by a special menu of options, along with
information about the current resolution.  That information tells how
many resolutions are currently stored and which one is currently shown.
When you select @code{resolve}, the program finds the first resolution and
displays it, showing information @samp{1 out of 1}, which means that it
has one resolution stored, and resolution number one is currently displayed.
The transcript area shows the effect of that resolution.

You can select @code{find another} to search for another resolution and add
it to its stored list.  When the list has more than one resolution in it,
selecting on @code{go to previous} and @code{go to next} will move around in its
list of previously found resolutions and show whichever one you want.
In this way, you can search
for a better resolution than the one you already have, but go back to
the earlier one if no better one is forthcoming.

Selecting @code{accept} will leave resolve mode, causing the current
resolution to be added to the sequence exactly as though you had
entered those calls manually.

Selecting @code{abort the search} (@code{Cancel} in the Macintosh
version) will throw away all of the saved resolutions and leave resolve
mode, but will not destroy the sequence.  The sequence will be left just
as it was before @code{resolve} was selected.

Selecting anything else, such as @code{exit} or @code{end this sequence},
is equivalent to @code{accept} followed by whatever that action
is.  So, for example, you can select @code{end this sequence} as soon as
you see a resolution that you like.

When using @code{sdtty}, these special commands are typed into the completing reader
in the usual way.  To make it more convenient to enter them, the command names
have been chosen to be unambiguous from just one or two letters.  So, for example,
@code{p} means @code{previous}, @code{n} means @code{next}, and @code{f}
means @code{find another}.

If one or more concepts have been entered when you select @code{resolve}, the
program will search only for resolutions whose first call starts with those
concepts.  So, for example, selecting @code{once removed} and then
@code{resolve} might get you this resolution:

@example
   ONCE REMOVED reverse the pass
   linear flow
   right and left grand  (7/8 promenade)
@end example

The program searches for resolutions by using a random number generator to
generate up to 5000 random sequences, occasionally inserting concepts.
It biases the search in favor of short sequences (one call) rather than
long ones (three calls) and against resolutions that require @i{all 8
circulate}, @i{pass thru}, or @i{trade by} at the end.
If, after 5000 attempts, no resolution is found, the @code{find another}
operation fails.  (This tends to happen if you try to resolve out of an
hourglass at Mainstream.)  You can select @code{find another} again to make
another 5000 attempts if you wish.

@i{Remember that the @code{resolve} operation by itself does not write
the sequence to a file.}  You will not be able to print a sequence until
it has been written to a file.  You must give the @code{end this sequence}
command to write out the sequence.

@node Normalize, Pick Random Call, Resolving, Resolving and Searching
@section Normalizing the setup

Selecting @code{normalize} invokes an operation very similar to the resolver,
except that it searches for sequences of up to three calls that normalize
various matrices, such as 4x4, into a normal 8-person setup.  It uses a variety
of phantom-like concepts to do its work.

Be aware that the phantom-like concepts that this command uses are not
the only ways to get out of large matrix setups.
There are a number of calls,
like @i{press},
@i{truck}, @i{loop}, @i{squeeze}, @i{Z axle}, and @i{finish a long trip}
that are also useful.
The @code{normalize} operation does not search for such things.  It is only
intended to search for things that might not be obvious.

If you have selected @code{toggle concept levels},
the @code{normalize} command may
make use of concepts that are not legal at the chosen level.  This is sometimes
useful in emergencies.

@node Pick Random Call, Reconcile, Normalize, Resolving and Searching
@section Letting the program pick a random call

Selecting @code{pick random call} invokes an operation very similar to the resolver,
except that it searches for any legal single call.  While this may sound like
a fairly pointless operation, remember that you can use this while one or
more concepts are already entered, in which case it will search for legal calls
that involve those concepts.  Hence, this operation is useful for finding
clever uses of difficult concepts such as @i{checkpoint},
@i{interlace}, or @i{on your own}.

@node Reconcile,  , Pick Random Call, Resolving and Searching
@section The @code{Reconcile} operation

Selecting @code{reconcile} invokes an operation like resolving, but it
puts the generated calls someplace other than at the end of the
sequence.  This is useful if you have a clever getout at the end of the
sequence, and you want it to be the resolve, but people don't have their
partners and corners.  This lets you retroactively modify the sequence
so that the clever getout will work.

Note first that this operation may only be invoked when the setup is
left-handed two-faced lines, right-handed waves, or left-handed waves,
in which case it assumes you want a @i{promenade}, @i{right and left grand}, or
@i{left allemande} respectively.  The program must know which getout type you
want.  If the setup is an 8-chain, it can't tell.  In that case, either
do a @code{touch} or a @code{left touch}, to tell the program that you really
want a @i{right and left grand} or @i{allemande left}, respectively.
Then, after the reconcile operation is complete, you can erase that extra call.

The reconcile operation is very similar in behavior to resolve, except
that the program needs to know the insertion point.  Rather than
searching for the first resolve as soon as you enter the mode, the
reconcile operation lets you set the insertion point before searching.
Select @code{raise insertion point} or @code{lower insertion point} to
set it.  A dotted line will be displayed showing where in the sequence
the generated calls will be placed.  When this is in the right place,
select @code{find another} to find the first reconcile.  You can
change the insertion point at any time.

If you are using the Macintosh version, you change the insertion point
using a utility window labelled @code{reconcile point} that appears
after you perform the @code{Resolve} command.  Simply drag the dotted
line to the place in the sequence where you want the generated calls to
be inserted.

Reconciles are extremely difficult to find---much harder than resolves.
To avoid frustration, make the insertion point be at a place where the
setup is very simple and a large number of calls are legal.  We recommend
making the insertion point be at a place where the setup is in waves.
Remember that, if the insertion point is at an hourglass, the program
has to find a random sequence of up to three calls that goes from an hourglass
to another hourglass while miraculously performing the required
permutation.

Avoid using reconcile when a gender-dependent or head/side-dependent
call lies between the insertion point and the end of the sequence.  The
program checks every reconcile by re-executing all calls from the
insertion point to the end and verifying that everything is exactly as
it was except for the permutation of the people.  For example, if the
call @samp{heads kickoff} occurs after the insertion point, and a
potential reconcile changes heads and sides, it will not be offered.
For gender-dependent calls the situation is a little better: if, at the
end of the sequence, the boys are in the center and the girls on the end
before doing the reconcile, you know that any inserted sequence will
have to be gender-preserving anyway, so calls like @samp{star thru} and
@samp{boys kickoff} will be okay.

@section Saving the Sequence

At any time when the sequence is resolved (for example, after a successful
use of the @code{resolve} operation), you can select @code{end this sequence}.
This will append the current sequence to the current output file, and then
go back to the startup screen.  You will be given an opportunity to enter
a line of text to be used as a subtitle, for example ``very hard interlace''
or ``stupid biggie.''  The written sequence will also be annotated with the
level, the current date and time, and the version numbers of the program and
database.

Until you have done the @code{end this sequence} operation, the sequence is not
written to disk and you cannot start writing a new sequence.  Just
resolving isn't enough.

If you are using the Macintosh version, files are handled differently.
@xref{Sequence Files}. To specify a label to be used as a subtitle,
use the @code{Label} command in the @code{Sequence} menu.

@node Change Output File, Abort/Exit/Undo, Save Sequence, Misc Commands
@section Changing the Output File

You can change the name of the file to which the program writes its
output by selecting the @code{Change output file} command.  A popup
will appear, prompting you for a new file name.  This action will become
effective the next time a sequence is written out.  Sequences previously
written will stay under their old name.

@node Abort/Exit/Undo, Inserting Comments, Change Output File, Misc Commands
@section @code{Abort}, @code{Exit}, and @code{Undo}

If you select the @code{exit} command, the program will exit.  If a
sequence is in progress, the program will ask for confirmation first.
(Remember that a sequence is not finished until the @code{end this
sequence} command has been given.)
In @code{sdtty} with the X Window System, using your window manager
to send a @code{Delete Window} message to the
program is equivalent to clicking on the @code{exit} button.  This is
what normally happens when you double-click the special control button in the
upper left corner of the @code{sd} window.

If you select the @code{abort} command, the program will abort the sequence
but not exit.  It will go back to the startup screen to allow you to
start another sequence.  It will ask for confirmation first.

If you are using the Macintosh version, you end a sequence and start a
new one using the @code{End This Sequence} command in the
@code{Sequence} menu.

If you select the @code{undo} command while no call is partially entered,
that is, while no concepts have been entered, the program will erase
the last complete call, with all of its concepts.  If one or more
concepts have been entered, only the last concept will be erased.

@node Inserting Comments, Keeping Pictures, Abort/Exit/Undo, Misc Commands
@section Inserting Comments

You can insert arbitrary text strings into the sequence transcript in the
form of @i{comments}.  This is useful for things that you may want to say
to help the dancers, such as ``side boys be careful---go to your left.''
Also, if you want to call something that the program can't do, so you have
to trick the program into doing it by means of several other calls, it is useful
to enter a comment saying what you originally wanted.  This can guide you
when editing the transcript file.

To enter a comment, select @code{insert a comment}.  In @code{sd}, a popup
will appear into which you may enter the text.  In @code{sdtty}, simply type
the comment text on the next line.  The comment will be enclosed in curly braces
in the transcript.

A comment may be entered in front of any concept or call, and goes into
the transcript exactly where it was entered.  Because of the way the program
assembles mouse-clicks into transcript lines, it is not possible to enter
a comment at the end of a line.

@node Keeping Pictures, Changing Modes, Inserting Comments, Misc Commands
@section Keeping Pictures

The program shows pictures on the screen for the current position
and the position just before the last call.  Normally, those pictures
will not appear in the sequence written to a file.  If you want the
current position to have its picture written in a file (say, because the
sequence is very difficult and you believe it may be necessary to say
something helpful then like ``check a parallelogram with boys in the center
box'') click on @code{keep picture}.

If you are using the Macintosh version, the picture stored in a sequence
file or log file uses alphanumeric characters, even if the sequence
window displays graphical symbols.  Similarly, if you copy text from the
sequence window, the copied text will use alphanumeric characters for
pictures.  However, if you have an appropriate symbol font, you can
recreate the pictures using graphical symbols by using the @code{Copy
Special Font} command in the @code{Edit} menu.  This command is like the
@code{Copy} command except that pictures are represented using encoded
text, where each graphical symbol is represented by a single ASCII
character.

or @code{sdtty} run.  The two commands are @code{toggle concept levels}
and @code{toggle active phantoms}.  Normally, both of these are off.
You may want to turn one or both of them on for your own personal
preference, or for some special reason.  These commands "toggle" their
respective modes.  That is, they turn the mode on if it was off, and
off if it was on.  The current state of the modes is always displayed
in the input prompt in @code{sdtty}, or the mode line in the upper
right corner in @code{sd}.

The @code{toggle concept levels} command changes the legality of concepts
that are not on the specified calling level.  @xref{Entering Concepts}.

The @code{toggle active phantoms} command changes the persistence of
phantoms during certain calls.  @xref{Assume Waves}.

@chapter Overview of the Macintosh Version

The Macintosh version of @code{sd} supports a graphical user interface
that can be driven entirely using the mouse.  The user interface is
generally similar to the X Window System user interface of @code{sd}, although
it has been adapted to follow standard Macintosh user interface
conventions, such as the use of pull down menus.  This section of the
document describes the unique features of the Macintosh user interface.
In the remainder of the document, comments are inserted to explain
specific differences in the Macintosh user interface.

In addition to mouse input, the Macintosh version of @code{sd} supports
keyboard input of calls and most commands (similar to @code{sdtty}).
Keyboard input can be used interchangeably with mouse input.  Keyboard
input is most useful when you know exactly what you want to do (and you
are a good typist).  Menus are useful when you want to select from a
display of available options.

@node Mac Requirements, Initial Dialog,  , Macintosh Overview
@section Macintosh System Requirements

The Macintosh version of @code{sd} was designed to run on System 6 or 7;
however, it has not been extensively tested on System 6.  If you have
difficultly running @code{sd}, please contact the authors.

The amount of memory required to run @code{sd} depends upon the calling
level you select.  Under normal use, @code{sd} runs in a 1Mb partition
at level @code{c4}.  If you are running System 7, this means you should
have at least 3Mb of RAM.


@node Initial Dialog, Mac Abridgement, Mac Requirements, Macintosh Overview
@section The Initial Dialog

An information window is displayed at startup;
this window can be dismissed by clicking anywhere on it with the mouse.

The initial dialog is entitled @code{sd options}.  It allows you to
select the calling level from a pull down menu.  The available levels
are: @code{mainstream}, @code{plus}, @code{a1}, @code{a2}, @code{c1},
@code{c2}, @code{c3a}, @code{c3}, @code{c3x}, @code{c4a}, or @code{c4}.
(An additional level @code{all} is provided primarily for use in
debugging call definitions.)  The calling level determines the calls and
concepts that will be made available, according to our best guess of
what the levels mean.

Once you have selected the desired calling level, click the @code{New
Sequence} button to begin a new call sequence.  The program will read a
set of call definitions from a call dictionary and then bring up the
sequence window.  Reading the call dictionary can take a few seconds or
even minutes, depending up the speed of your machine and the calling
level you have selected.


@node Mac Abridgement, Creating Dictionaries, Initial Dialog, Macintosh Overview
@section Abridgement

@code{Sd} allows you to alter the set of calls it knows about by
striking out specific calls.  This feature can be used, for example,
when teaching a class, so that calls that have not yet been taught
will not be used.

To use this feature, you must first prepare a text file containing the
names of the calls to be avoided.  The @code{Sd} menu contains a
@code{Save Call List} command that can be used to create a file
containing the names of all calls defined at the selected level.  The
file selection dialog that appears includes a check box labelled
@code{Include Lower Level Calls} that allows you to select whether to
include calls defined at lower levels or only include those calls
introduced at the current calling level.  Once the text file has been
created, you can edit it with a text editor to contain only the names of
calls you want to avoid.  The @code{Save Call List} command can be used
only while the initial dialog is displayed.

The initial dialog contains a button labelled @code{Abridge}.  This
button brings up a file selection dialog, which you use to select the
file containing the list of calls to avoid.  These calls are removed
from the menus for the duration of this execution of the program.  When
this feature is used, every sequence listing will say @samp{(abridged)}
after its level.

The lines in the abridgement file must always be in exactly the same
format as the strings that are written out by the @code{Save Call List}
command.  The program has no tolerance for creative capitalization,
stray blanks, or other variations.  Any line in the file that does not
match a call in the menu is simply ignored.  Because the names of calls
are sometimes changed in new versions of @code{sd}, you may need to
reconstruct your abridgement file after installing a new version of
@code{sd}.

To write sequences for a group that is learning C2, for example, use the
@code{Save Call List} command, turn off the @code{Include Lower Level
Calls} check box, and write to a file, say @file{my_group}.  Use a text
editor to delete from the file @file{my_group} those C2 calls that the
group has learned, i.e., those calls @i{not} to be avoided.  Then, when
writing sequences, use the @code{Abridge} button and select the file
@file{my_group}.  As the group learns new C2 calls, delete the
corresponding lines from the file @file{my_group}.  That file always
contains the calls that they don't yet know.  When the file goes to
zero, they know the whole list.


@node Creating Dictionaries, Preferences, Mac Abridgement, Macintosh Overview
@section Creating New Call Dictionaries

@code{Sd} obtains its definitions of calls from a file called a call
dictionary.  A standard call dictionary is supplied with @code{sd}.
you can also create your own call dictionary and select among multiple
call dictionaries.

A call dictionary is created by compiling a call definition file.  A
call definition file is a text file containing call definitions in a
particular format.  The format is described in a separate document
@file{db_doc.txt}.  To compile a call dictionary, use the @code{Compile
Call Dictionary} command in the @code{Sd} menu.

To select a call dictionary other than the default one, use the
@code{Select Call Dictionary} command in the @code{Sd} menu.  The
@code{Select Call Dictionary} command can be used only while the initial
dialog is displayed.

The default call dictionary is the file @file{sd_calls.dat} in the
directory containing the @code{sd} application file.


@node Preferences, Sequence Files, Creating Dictionaries, Macintosh Overview
@section Preferences

@code{Sd} allows you to alter certain options that are retained between
executions of the program.  These options are displayed and modified
using a dialog box entitled @code{sd Preferences}.  To bring up this
dialog box, use the @code{Preferences} command in the @code{Sd} menu.
Using the preferences dialog box, you can change the default calling
level displayed in the initial dialog box when you start the program.
You can also choose whether to display formations using graphical
symbols or alphanumeric characters and whether or not to display each
couple using different colors.  Using different colors is visually
attractive, but it slows down the program considerably.


@node Sequence Files, Log Files, Preferences, Macintosh Overview
@section Sequence Files

The Macintosh version of @code{sd} stores the call sequences you create
as individual files.  These files are text files and can be edited with
a text editor or included in a document.  The current sequence can be
saved at any time using the @code{Save} or @code{Save As} commands in
the @code{File} menu.


@node Log Files, Sequence Window, Sequence Files, Macintosh Overview
@section Log Files

In addition to storing call sequences as individual files, the Macintosh
version of @code{sd} allows you to collect multiple sequences in a
single text file, called a log file.  In this way, you can create a
single file containing an entire evening's program, for example.

The commands for writing log files are contained in the @code{Log}
submenu of the @code{File} menu.  Each command writes a copy of the
current sequence to a log file.  The @code{New Log} command writes a
copy of the current sequence to a new log file.  The @code{Append to
File} allows you to select an existing log file; the current sequence is
appended to that file.  The @code{Append} command appends a copy of the
current sequence to the log file you specified previously.  The
name of the current log file is displayed in the title bar of the
sequence window with the prefix @code{log:}.

Although these commands can be used at any time, they are normally used
only when you have completed a sequence.


@node Sequence Window, Call Window, Log Files, Macintosh Overview
@section The Sequence Window

When working on a call sequence, the sequence and the current setup
are displayed in a window called the sequence window.  The title of the
sequence window displays the name of the sequence file, if any.

The top portion of the sequence window displays a transcript of the
current call sequence.  Intermixed with the calls are pictures that show
the setup at that point in the sequence.  Normally, only two pictures
are shown, the current setup and the setup prior to the last call.  (The
@code{Keep Picture} command can be used to retain additional pictures in
the transcript.)  The transcript also includes warning messages, error
message, and input prompts.  The transcript pane supports the @code{Copy}
command for copying text from the pane to the clipboard.

Below the transcript pane is an area used for input.  Depending upon the
current activity, this area either displays a set of buttons or it shows
a text box for entering calls.  The text box supports the normal text
editing operations, including transferring text via the clipboard.

At the bottom of the sequence window is status pane containing three
boxes.  The calling level is displayed in the left box.  The current
setup is displayed in the middle box; this name corresponds to the
current menu of calls displayed by the program.  The right box displays
status information when resolving a square.


@node Call Window, Keyboard Input, Sequence Window, Macintosh Overview
@section The Call Window

Normally, when you are creating a call sequence, a utility window
labelled @code{Matching Calls} is displayed that shows the set of calls
and concepts that are available.  Calls are displayed first, in
alphabetical order.  Concepts are displayed after the calls, in an order
that attempts to group related concepts together and put simple concepts
first.  Finally, the call window displays commands that are equivalent to
the pull down menu commands.

The calls and concepts that are displayed in the call window are
selected based on the current setup.  This selection is approximate but
conservative---appearance of a call or concept on the menu does not
necessarily mean it is legal, though absence from the menu means that
the program is fairly certain that it can't be legal.

To select a call, concept, or command from the call window, double click
on it.

The call window contains a button labelled @code{Validate}.  When you
click this button, the program performs a more careful check to see
which concepts and calls are possible from the current setup and removes
those which are not possible.  This feature is very useful to suggest
ideas for possible calls in a given situation.  The time needed to
determine the valid concepts and calls varies depending upon the setup
and the calling level.  Although normally validation is quite fast, it
is not fast enough to want to do it automatically after every call.


@node Keyboard Input, Hiding Couple Numbers, Call Window, Macintosh Overview
@section Keyboard Input

When working on a call sequence, you can enter calls and concepts using
the keyboard.  You can also enter most of the commands that are
available on menus.  Keyboard input is echoed in the text box in the
input pane of the sequence window.  Terminate a call, concept, or
command by typing @key{Return}, @key{Enter}, or clicking on the
@code{Accept} button.

Keyboard input supports automatic completion, meaning that you need type
only as much of each word as will make the word unique.  When you type
@key{Space}, @code{sd} will complete the word for you if it can.  When
you type @key{Return}, @key{Enter}, or @key{Tab}, @code{sd} will
complete the entire phrase.  So, for example, if the setup is waves and
the level is mainstream, you could type just @code{sw th} and
@key{Return} to get a @i{swing thru}.  In fact, just @code{sw} and
@key{Return} is enough.  Typing a question mark (@key{?}) is equivalent
to clicking on the @code{Validate} button.

@node Hiding Couple Numbers, , Keyboard Input, Macintosh Overview
@section Hiding Couple Numbers

If you are using the Macintosh version and displaying formations using
graphical symbols, you can select whether or not to display couple
numbers using the @code{Hide Couple Numbers} or @code{Reveal Couple
Numbers} commands in the @code{Sequence} menu.

@node Sdtty, Sdtty on the PC,  , Terminal Interface
@section Sdtty

The program @code{sdtty} uses the completing reader for call,
concept, and command entry.

When typing, press @key{Space} to complete the current word.
Type @key{TAB} or @key{ESC} to complete as much as possible.
Type @kbd{C-u} (that is, Control U) to clear a partially-typed line.

@code{sdtty} has a special command @code{refresh display}
that has no counterpart in
the window-based version.  It causes a complete clean transcript
of the current sequence to be printed.  This can be used if the display got
messed up due to such things as unreliable terminal or modem behavior.

@code{sdtty} tries to keep the screen up-to-date efficiently,
maintaining a clean transcript of the current sequence on the screen
at all times, by using whatever Operating System facilities it thinks are
appropriate.  If, for any reason, this doesn't work properly for you,
you can give the @code{-no_cursor} switch at program startup to disable
that.  This will cause @code{sdtty} to treat the computer's display as
if it were a dumb typewriter.  When started in this way, the part of
the transcript that has changed with each command is simply redisplayed.
This will inevitably lead to a choppy appearance on the screen or
printing device.  The @code{refresh display} command cleans that up.

@node Sdtty on the PC, Sdtty on Unix, Sdtty, Terminal Interface
@section Sdtty on the PC

Our DOS compiler, DJGPP, says it supports 80386, 80387, 80486, XMS,
himem.sys, VCPI, DPMI, QEMM, 386MAX, and DesqView.
We have also heard it works with Microsoft's EMM386 and Qualitas's
@w{386 MAX}.
(You need EMS; for EMM386, this means that you can't use the
@code{NOEMS} option.  This may require that you remove the @code{NOEMS}
option from the @code{CONFIG.SYS} file.)
The authors have not tested Sd with all of these.

To run under DOS, you need a 386 or higher processor and 2Mb of memory.
A hard disk is recommended.  There
should be at least 175 kilobytes of memory free in the first 640Kb.
The authors have not actually tried it on a system this small, and we
would be interested in your experiences.

@code{Sd} is believed to be
insensitive to slight inaccuracies in floating-point division.

To deal with different types of display hardware with various screen sizes,
the @code{-lines @var{n}} switch can be given at program startup, as in
@code{sdtty -lines 36 a2}.  The default size is 25.

@node Sdtty on Unix,  , Sdtty on the PC, Terminal Interface
@section Sdtty on Unix

The Unix version normally uses the @i{curses} display access mechanism.  It
should make effective use of the screen-editing features of the terminal
(VT-100 or emulation of same, or whatever) to keep the screen updated.
However, this requires that all of the system facilities for dealing with
terminals (@code{TERM} environment variable, @code{terminfo} database,
@code{stty} behavior, etc.) be working properly.
If, for any reason, this doesn't
work for you, you can turn the @i{curses} mechanism off completely by using the
@code{-no_cursor} command-line switch at program startup.  This should even
make it possible to use the program from a printing device.

When using @i{curses}, it normally tries to use the insert/delete line
capabilities of your terminal device to update the screen more efficiently.
For certain terminal or modem configurations, this may be
counterproductive.  If so, you can turn this feature off
by giving the command-line switch
@code{-no_line_delete} at program startup.

@node Linguistic Idiosyncrasies, Call Notes, Terminal Interface, Top
@chapter Linguistic Idiosyncrasies

In a number of cases, the program behaves in a way that could be considered
idiosyncratic, peculiar, or simply wrong.
Some of these cases are admittedly bugs
or shortcomings of the program.  Others are inevitable consequences of what the
program is trying to do.

The syntax, semantics, and general structure of the square dance calling
language is fairly regular and precise---much more so than, for
example, the English language.  That is, the correspondence between dancer
actions and verbal phrases is fairly regular.  However, there are exceptions.
A very simple example of this is the fact that callers generally say
@samp{quarter top} and @samp{half the top}, using the word ``the'' in
one case but not the other.

The program handles these exceptions by calling in an occasionally stilted but
unambiguous computer-ese dialect.  This dialect is intended to be
very close to the words you would use when calling, but it is sometimes
different.
The rationale for this is that it is too hard to make the program always use
the words that a caller would use.  When writing sequences, be aware that the
dancers do not necessarily know this computer-ese dialect.  Use the words
that you think are correct and natural.  Your judgement is much better than any
program's judgement can ever be.

The program sometimes requires you to say various "helper" words, such
as @code{left} in cases where their necessity is is not universally
agreed upon.  For example, from a left-handed quarter-tag, @code{sd}
will not accept @code{scoot and plenty}---you are required to enter
@code{left scoot and plenty}, even though the Callerlab definition does
not require the word @code{left} in this case.  What helper words you
use or don't use when calling is, of course, up to you.

There are some innocent-looking things that the program can generate for which
appropriate words do not exist.  You must not write sequences containing such
things, because you won't be able to call them.  For example, from
boy-boy-girl-girl
waves, it is perfectly straightforward for a caller to say @samp{boys hinge}.
(However, the program requires that you enter this as @samp{boys only hinge}.)
From boy-girl-boy-girl waves, @samp{boys hinge} is meaningless, but the
program accepts
@samp{boys do your part, hinge}.  It doesn't know that this is an unacceptable
thing to call.  Don't do it.

In general, if you don't think you can clearly express to the dancers
what you want, don't call it.

A number of concepts are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon.
See @ref{Twice}, @ref{Precede it or Follow it}, and @ref{So-And-So}.

Callers often indulge in a form of poetic license, using phrases such as
@samp{like a @dots{}} or @samp{finish like a @dots{}}.
For example, at C2 one could
say @samp{cast off 3/4 like a shazam}.  Since @i{shazam} means cast off (arm
turn) 1/4 and then U-turn back, this is readily understood by the dancers
to mean arm turn 3/4 and then U-turn back.

It does not follow that @samp{like a shazam} means to U-turn back at the
end of the call.  Calling @samp{pass and roll like a shazam} would cause
a great deal of consternation.  @samp{<anything> like a shazam} is only
reasonable when the <anything> is logically very similar to an arm turn 1/4.
It would be very difficult for a computer program to understand how to
characterize the calls that are reasonable, and Sd does not attempt
to do so.

Because of this potential for misuse, Sd does not support very many things
of the form @samp{like a @dots{}} or @samp{finish like a @dots{}}.
In many cases, you
can use explicit substitution to get this effect.  For example, by clicking on
@code{allow modifications}, you can enter @code{shazam BUT REPLACE
arm turn 1/4 WITH [cast off 3/4]} which you can then read as @samp{cast off
3/4 like a shazam}.  If you wish to enter such a thing, or enter
@code{cast off 3/4}
and @code{U-turn back} and then edit the transcript file with a text editor,
or just extemporize while calling, by all means do so.

The program @i{does} recognize the @samp{finish} concept.  It has potential
for abuse.  See @ref{Finish}.

The program does not currently remember sweeping direction from the
preceding call.  Hence, it assumes clockwise.

Of course, you must not say the word @i{reverse} when calling it.

@node C1 Single Rotate, Spread, Sweeping Direction, Call Notes

@samp{Single rotate while the others} is intended to be called to the

this call.  It is nonsensical in other contexts.

@node Spread, Flip Back, C1 Single Rotate, Call Notes

In addition to all of the tagging calls (@xref{Call Variations}),

which is the usual way of expressing this.

@node Face <DIRECTION>, Snag Circulate, Flip Back, Call Notes
@section Face <DIRECTION>

The call @samp{face <DIRECTION>} does not appear to be a genuine
Callerlab-sanctioned call.  It is intended to be used, for example,
after @samp{tag the line}, to give the direction that you wish to
have the dancers face.  So, for example, you could enter the calls
@samp{tag the line} followed by @samp{face in} to get the action
that is commonly expressed as @samp{tag the line, in}.  Note that
the A2 designators @samp{zig-zag} etc. are among the permissible
directions.

@node Snag Circulate, Colliding Recycle, Face <DIRECTION>, Call Notes
@section Snag Circulate

The @samp{snag} concept, meaning to have the centers do just half of the
call, does not work with the call @samp{circulate}, because that
call is not defined in the database as having centers' and ends' parts.
Hence, the separate call @samp{snag circulate} has been provided.

@node Colliding Recycle, Rotate from Columns, Snag Circulate, Call Notes
@section Colliding @i{Recycle}

``Colliding'' @i{recycle}, @i{ah so}, and @i{cycle and wheel} are not implemented.
Do not call these if the ends of the line are facing the same way.
@samp{Wheel and deal} from a one-faced line is okay.

@node Rotate from Columns, Recycle, Colliding Recycle, Call Notes
@section Rotate from Columns

Remember that @i{rotate} and @i{single rotate} from columns is legal only
at C3, but from lines it is legal at C2.  Since the program has no
knowledge of different starting setups implying different levels, the call
is in the database at C2.  Don't use it from columns at that level.

@node Recycle,  , Rotate from Columns, Call Notes
@section Recycle

There are two @i{Recycle} calls in the database: @samp{recycle} can be done
from waves, facing couples, right-handed boxes, or a couple facing a
right-handed mini-wave.  It can take the @samp{cross}, @samp{single}, or
@samp{diamond} modifiers.  It is the call that dancers will do when told
to @i{recycle}, and is the call that is used in @i{cover up} and
@i{counterpoint}.

Unfortunately, there is no mechanism for the program to recognize a call
as being fractionalizable in some setups but not others, and the
facing-couples version of recycle is not fractionalizable.
To permit fractional use of recycle, as with
@samp{interlace} or @samp{random}, we have provided a call
@samp{recycle (by parts)}, which can be done only from lines.  Use this call
(but don't read the ``by parts'' phrase) when fractions are required.

The former two are equivalent to @i{split phantom

For all of these concepts, if people are T-boned, you can use @code{standard}

and removed where possible at the conclusion of the call.

@node Concentric, Two Calls, Divided, Concept Notes
@section Concentric

The @samp{concentric} and @samp{cross concentric} concepts are formulated
as follows:
The rule tells how the people who finish on the outside should
elongate their 2x2 if they finish in a 2x2.  This is the only
case that needs to be addressed.

@enumerate
@item
If the people who finished on the outside in a 2x2 started
in a 2x2, they use the ``lines-to-lines/columns-to-columns'' rule,
relative to what setup @i{they} thought they were in.

If the concept was @i{concentric}, so these people started on
the outside in an elongated 2x2, they can make a decision about
whether they had line or column elongation.  They do not have
to be in a 2x4 for this.  For example, from a dogbone created by
Heads touch, the sides think they are in columns.  But from ordinary
diamonds or an hourglass, they think they are in lines.

If the concept was @i{cross concentric}, so these people started in the
center in a 2x2, they must have the assistance of the original ends.
The original setup must have been a 2x4, except for weird pinwheel-like
setups noted below.  Hence it is @i{illegal} to call @i{cross concentric
@w{square thru 2}} from a rigger in which the center box is facing couples
and the wings have right hands and are expected to rear back.  The
centers do not know whether they were in lines or columns because the
ends are not in an acceptable setup.  The centers do @i{not} use the
``checkpoint elongate perpendicular to the 1x4 rule''---that rule does not
apply here.  If the outsides are in a pinwheel, that is, occupying a 4x4
matrix in an irregular way, each center
makes the line vs.@: columns decision based on the end person in their own
quadrant.  That is, the center person's own facing direction and that
end person's @i{location,} but not that end person's facing direction.

@item
If the people who finished on the outside in a 2x2 started
in a 1x4 or diamond, they use the @dfn{checkpoint rule}---they elongate
their resulting 2x2 perpendicular to the long axis of @i{their own}
1x4 or diamond, not the long axis of the set.

If the concept was @i{concentric}, so these people started on
the outside in a 1x4 or diamond, their own long axis is presumably
the same as the long axis of the whole set.

If the concept was @i{cross concentric}, so these people started in
the center in a 1x4 or diamond, their own long axis might not be the
long axis of the set.  If we do @i{cross concentric @w{square thru 2}}
from a center wave perpendicular to outside miniwaves, so everyone
rears back, the original centers
finish perpendicular to their own 1x4, not the original ends' 1x4.
They finish in approximately the places where the ends began.
If we do it from a 1/4 tag, the centers finish where the ends began.

@node Two Calls, Assume Waves, Concentric, Concept Notes
@section Two Calls in Succession

The @code{do two calls in succession} concept allows a pair of calls to
be executed atomically under a concept.  This makes it possible to do
a @samp{concentric (recycle ; roll)} and have the lines-to-lines
rule embrace the roll.  The script will appear as above.  The proper way
to say the concept when calling is problematical.  Something like @samp{consider
the following two calls to be one unit, and do a stable swing thru and turn thru}
might be appropriate.

@node Assume Waves, Diamond, Two Calls, Concept Notes
@section Assume Waves

There are several concepts that you can use to tell the dancers how phantoms
are facing.  They are
@example
   @code{assume waves}
   @code{assume miniwaves}
   @code{assume two-faced lines}
   @code{assume one-faced lines}
   @code{assume inverted lines}
   @code{assume inverted boxes}
   @code{assume normal columns}
   @code{assume magic columns}
   @code{assume eight chain}
   @code{assume trade by}
   @code{assume dpt}
   @code{assume cdpt}
   @code{assume facing lines}
   @code{assume back-to-back lines}
   @code{assume general diamonds}
   @code{assume general 1/4 tags}
   @code{assume right 1/4 tags}
   @code{assume left 1/4 tags}
   @code{assume left 3/4 tags}
   @code{assume right 3/4 tags}
   @code{assume right 1/4 lines}
   @code{assume left 1/4 lines}
   @code{assume left 3/4 lines}
   @code{assume right 3/4 lines}
   @code{assume normal diamonds}
   @code{assume facing diamonds}
   @code{assume normal interlocked diamonds}
   @code{assume facing interlocked diamonds}
@end example

Additionally, there are two related concepts, @code{assume normal casts} and
@code{with active phantoms}, that will be discussed below.

When these concepts are used by themselves, the information
that they convey tells the dancers how to begin certain calls such as
@samp{hinge}, @samp{vertical tag}, and @samp{in roll circulate}.
The information is thrown away after the call begins.  That is, the program
does not hold the dancers responsible for tracking phantoms through a call.
It only tells them how to begin.

Use these concepts with care.  Many dancers don't like to be held responsible
for the facing direction of phantoms.

These concepts will be implicitly applied whenever something like @code{split
phantom waves} or @code{triple diamonds} is used.  See below.

It is of course illegal to use one of these concepts, either explicitly
with @code{assume} or implicitly with something like @code{split phantom
waves}, if the live dancers are not facing in a way that is consistent with
the assumption.

@subsection Split Phantom Waves, etc.

The various concepts that name a virtual formation, like @code{split phantom waves},
@code{offset waves}, @code{triple 1/4 tags} and @code{quadruple diamonds}, may
contain an implicit @code{assume} in them.

For the concepts that name @dfn{lines}, such as @code{split phantom lines} and
@code{triple lines}, there are equivalent concepts with the word @code{waves}
instead of @code{lines}.  These cause an implicit @code{assume waves}.
So, for example, in columns, @code{split phantom waves in roll circulate}, which
is equivalent to @code{split phantom lines assume waves in roll circulate}, tells
the live dancers which way the phantom in-roller is facing.  The call @code{split
phantom lines in roll circulate} is illegal from columns because the facing
direction of the phantom in-roller is unknown.

For the concepts that name some kind of @dfn{diamonds} or @dfn{1/4 tags}, there
are 5 types of setups that can be named.  They are
@example
   @code{diamonds}
   @code{diamond spots}
   @code{1/4-tags}
   @code{3/4-tags}
   @code{general 1/4-tags}
@end example

For example, there are concepts @code{split phantom diamonds}, @code{split phantom
diamond spots}, @code{split phantom 1/4-tags}, etc.

When using these concepts, @code{diamonds} gives an implicit assumption @code{assume
general diamonds}, that is, it requires that everyone think they are individually
in some kind of diamond, with their right or left hand toward the center.
You may give an explicit @code{assume} concept to make the setup more specific if
you wish, as in @code{split phantom diamonds} followed by @code{assume interlocked
diamonds}.

The @code{general 1/4-tags} designator gives an implicit assumption @code{assume
general 1/4 tags}, that is, the centers must be in some kind of line, and the
ends must be in some kind of couple or miniwave.  The word @dfn{general} means
that the in-or-out facing direction of the outsides is unimportant, but they
must be facing in or out, not sideways as in diamonds.

The @code{1/4-tags} or @code{3/4 tags} designators assume some kind of line in
the middle, and the ends as a couple facing in or out, respectively.
Hence, for example, the @code{split phantom 1/4 tags} concept includes 1/4 tags,
1/4 lines, or any kind of line in the center, as long as the ends are facing in.
You may use a concept like @code{assume right 1/4 lines} to be more specific
about it.

The @code{diamond spots} designator makes no assumptions at all.  The people can
be in any kind of general diamond or general 1/4 tag.  Use this when people's
facing directions are bizarre.

@subsection Assume Normal Casts

The concept @code{assume normal casts} may be used in cases in which you
do not require the dancers to track phantoms through the call, but you
want to resolve any ambiguity about the @samp{cast off 3/4} operations
that happen at the end of such calls as @samp{chain reaction} and
@samp{motivate}.  You might read such an operation as @samp{12 matrix
motivate, assume the final cast off is normal}.

@subsection With Active Phantoms

The concept @code{with active phantoms}, used after one of the @code{assume}
concepts (either implicit or explicit), effectively places invisible but
otherwise intelligent dancers
on the phantom spots, with facing directions deduced from the assumption.
Those phantoms proceed through the entire call, interacting with each other
and with the live dancers as necessary.  If the call is impossible for the
phantoms do, or if illegal collisions occur between live dancers and phantoms.
an error message is printed.  At the end of the call, any live dancers or
phantoms that come to the same spot may take right hands with each other,
if that is appropriate for the call.

Most of the types of @code{assume} concepts listed above are sufficiently
explicit that, if even a single live dancer is present in the setup, everyone's
facing direction may be inferred.  This is necessary for the @code{with active
phantoms} concept, of course.  For example, a single live dancer can determine
the handedness of all the phantoms when @code{assume two-faced lines} is given.
Two of the concepts are not sufficiently explicit for this, and may not be used
with @code{with active phantoms}.  They are

@example
   @code{assume general diamonds}
   @code{assume general 1/4 tags}
@end example

If you are going to use @code{with active phantoms}, you must give more detailed
assumptions than these two, such as @code{assume left 1/4 lines} or @code{assume
facing diamonds}.

Use the @code{with active phantoms} concept with extreme care, if at all.
It is extremely dangerous in terms of what it may require the dancers to do.
Many dancers find it difficult enough to do the live people's parts of calls
without having to do the phantoms' parts also.

You can put @code{sd} into a mode in which there is an implicit
@code{with active phantoms} whenever any assumption is made.
The @code{toggle active phantoms} command toggles (turns on or off)
this mode.  @xref{Changing Modes}.
When in this mode, @code{sd} will not actually insert the text
@code{with active phantoms} after each @code{assume} concept.
It will, however, put the annotation "(AP)" into the title line of any
card that uses it, to remind you of why the dancers are having such a hard time.

@node Diamond, Rewind, Assume Waves, Concept Notes
@section Diamond

You should not need to click on @code{diamond} except when you actually
want the diamond concept, as in @i{diamond single wheel} or @i{diamond swing
thru}.  There are cases in which it may seem that the word @i{diamond}
ought to be added after clicking on @code{interlocked} and/or
@code{magic}.  The program will insert the extra word @i{diamond} for
you.  (At least, that is the intention.)  So, for example, clicking on
@code{magic} and then @code{alter the diamond} will get @samp{magic
diamond, alter the diamond}, and clicking on @code{magic},
@code{interlocked}, @code{diamond}, @code{as couples}, and @code{quarter
right} will get @samp{magic interlocked diamond, diamond as couples
quarter right}.

@node Rewind, Implied Piecewise, Diamond, Concept Notes
@section Rewind

There is no @samp{rewind} concept in this program.
A small number of individual @samp{rewind} calls may be in
the database.

@node Implied Piecewise, Twice, Rewind, Concept Notes
@section Implied Piecewise

Some of the replacement/interruption meta-concepts push the
semantics of the language to the limit.  Whenever a call undergoes an
interruption or enters or leaves a part with an additional concept on it,
there is an implicit @i{piecewise} at that instant.  That is, concepts and
setups are re-evaluated.
This behavior is not always obvious to the dancers.
Furthermore, in some cases it may be perceived as wrong.  For example, an
implied @i{piecewise} on a concept such as @i{cross concentric} or
@i{single cross concentric} is very likely to be considered wrong,
because the centers and ends will switch with each other multiple times.
If you have any doubt about whether some instance of concept stacking is
correct and will be understood by the dancers, do not use it.

Furthermore, replacements and interruptions are @i{normal}, that is, they
do not carry any concepts that were on the call being replaced---only
those on the entire operation.

Example, from a starting DPT setup:

@example
DELAY: TANDEM TWOSOME clean sweep 1/4 BUT REPLACE THE 3rd
PART WITH A [CHECKPOINT crossfire BY crossfire]
@end example

Normally, the tandem twosome behavior is not re-evaluated after each
part of the clean sweep.  But, since the third part was replaced with
something else to which that concept did not apply, the setup is
re-evaluated before doing the final part.  Note in particular that
the replacement was @i{normal}---the call having a part replaced was a
@i{tandem twosome clean sweep 1/4}.  If we wanted the entire operation,
including the replacement, to be tandem twosome (with no re-evaluation,
of course) we might call:
@example
TANDEM TWOSOME DELAY: clean sweep 1/4 BUT REPLACE THE 3rd
PART WITH A [SINGLE CROSS CONCENTRIC turn thru]
@end example

If you think that some instance of a replacement or interruption will
cause confusion on the dance floor because of this sort of issue,
you should not use it.

@node Twice, Precede it or Follow it, Implied Piecewise, Concept Notes
@section Twice

The @code{twice} concept simply causes the subject call to be executed
twice.  This is a notion familiar at all levels from Mainstream
(@samp{spin chain thru, the girls double circulate}) to C4 (@samp{piecewise
twice, recoil}).  No universally recognized words for this exist,
so the program uses the generic phrase @code{twice}.  When calling,
use whatever words you think are appropriate.

@node Precede it or Follow it, So-And-So, Twice, Concept Notes
@section Precede it or Follow it

The concepts @code{precede it by} and @code{follow it by} take two subject
calls.  They perform the first call (first in textual order, that is)
@i{before} or @i{after}, respectively, the second.  For example,
@code{follow it by roll, swing thru} does a swing thru and roll.
There is only one context in which these concepts are sensible---they can be
the subject of the @code{piecewise}, @code{random}, or @code{reverse random}
meta-concepts.  For example, @code{piecewise follow it by criss cross the
deucey, turn the key} will do a @samp{criss cross the deucey}
after each of the three parts of @samp{turn the key}.

These concepts are among the situations in which the program does not attempt
to print out the exact words that are appropriate to use when calling, but
instead prints out an unambiguous description of what is supposed to happen.
The exact words you should use depend on the context and on your judgement.
You might say @code{piecewise add a criss cross the deucey, and turn the key},
or @code{do a criss cross the deucey after each part, and turn the key}, or
something similar.

@node So-And-So, Finish, Precede it or Follow it, Concept Notes
@section So-And-So

There are four closely related concepts here.  You must have a clear
understanding of how the program treats them in order to use them effectively.
Compared to the natural and fluent way most dancers and callers use these
ideas, the program may seem idiosyncratic and ignorant in its handling of them.
@xref{Linguistic Idiosyncrasies}.

The four concepts are @code{so-and-so}, @code{so-and-so disconnected},
@code{so-and-so do your part}, and @code{own the <so-and-so>}.

@example
   @code{<so-and-so>, <call>}
         or
   @code{<so-and-so>, <call> while the others <other call>}
@end example

This means find the maximal connected undistorted subsets, and
do the call in those subsets.  For example, from boy-boy-girl-girl waves,
the boys are in two miniwaves that have nothing to do with
each other.  The boys can do 2-person calls, such as trade or hinge,
in those setups.  If the others are told to do a second call, they do it
in their connected undistorted subsets.  For example, we could say
@code{boys, hinge while the others shazam}.  The results will be
reassembled as a 2x4, a C1-phantom setup, stars, or something similar.

From boy-girl-boy-girl waves, the boys are in 4 1-person connected undistorted
setups.  Using this concept, the boys can quarter right, but they can't trade
or hinge.

Now it is commonly accepted practice to say @samp{boys trade} when the boys are
looking out, and have them effectively trade the wave.  This is because
the call @samp{trade} is a special case, not because calls in general can be
done from that setup.  To see this, consider the call @code{roll away}.
It, and two-person calls in general, are @i{not} legal unless the people are
adjacent.  The special property of the call @code{trade}, that it can be done
by designated people who are not adjacent, is simply an idiosyncrasy that
everyone knows.
The Sd program recognizes this by having a call in its database
@code{<anyone> trade} as well as the call @code{trade}.  Use that call, not
the @code{<anyone>} concept, to get the appropriate people to trade
down the line when in waves.

If you really want non-adjacent people to @code{roll away}, use the
@code{disconnected} concept.

Incidentally, this is why the concept has a comma in it.
Without it, the line @code{boys trade} appearing on a printed sequence would be ambiguous.
The Sd program is designed to make it possible to determine unambiguously, by looking at
the printout, how an action arose.  Of course, in many cases, you
may find that the comma goes against your judgement of how to phrase the
call for maximum dancer success.  Use your own judgement, of course.

@example
   @code{<so-and-so> disconnected <call>} or
         or
   @code{<so-and-so> disconnected <call> while the others <other call>}
@end example

This is like @code{<so-and-so>}, but finds the maximal undistorted subsets,
whether they are connected or not.  This is a recognized C2 concept.  It is
generally intended to be used from grand (1x8) setups, in which the designated
people leave the room and compress themselves into a 1x4 setup.  After doing
the call they come back and place themselves in the same four spaces that
they had vacated.  A few shape-changing calls are permitted.  In this case,
whichever set of people occupied the center spots prior to the call will
occupy the center of the result, in accordance with accepted usage for
this concept.

@example
   @code{<so-and-so> do your part, <call>}
         or
   @code{<so-and-so> do your part, <call> while the others <other call>}
@end example

This means that the non-designated dancers leave the room and re-form their own
setup in another room.  The setups are not shrink-wrapped---they stay
the same size in each room, with phantoms where the other people are.
The appropriate call is done in each room.  The non-designees come back,
and the two setups are merged.  This merging operation is similar to that
used for @code{<so-and-so>}.  It may result in things like C1-phantom
setups.  From boy-boy-girl-girl waves, @code{boys do your part, hinge}
will leave C1 phantom setups, just as @code{boys, hinge} will.
In fact, the difference
between these concepts is rather subtle in many cases.  The important point
is that, in each room, the dancers work in the entire setup.  For example,
from facing lines, if the centers do their part of @code{right and left thru},
they work on their own side, with the nonexistent ends, rather than working
in the center.

From boy-girl-boy-girl waves, @code{boys do your part, hinge} creates a mess.
No sensible dancer would consider it acceptable.  Do not use such things.

@example
   @code{own the <so-and-so>, <call> by <other call>}
@end example

This is similar to the @code{<so-and-so> do your part} concept, except that the
result setups are reassembled according to strict matrix positions.  That
is, instead of a C1 phantom setup, a 4x4 matrix may result.
This is a recognized C3A concept.

In all of these concepts, the program will always use the word @dfn{others} for
the non-designated people.  When calling, you should probably say something
more intelligent, like @dfn{girls} or @dfn{sides} or whatever.

In general, be aware that the choice of words and punctuation that the program
uses for these concepts is determined by the need to avoid ambiguity, and may
not be the words that you should use when calling.  For example, if the program
prints out @samp{boys, hinge}, it may be more natural to say just
@samp{boys hinge}.  Similarly, if the program prints out @samp{boys do your
part, transfer the column while the others switch the wave}, it may be more
natural to say @samp{everyone do your part, boys transfer the column while
the girls switch the wave}.  As in all aspects of calling, choose your
words carefully.

@node Finish, 12 Matrix and 16 Matrix, So-And-So, Concept Notes
@section Finish

To Sd, this concept means ``skip the first part,'' and is only legal for
certain calls---those for which dancers would generally agree on this meaning.
However, it is still somewhat dangerous, since the actual meaning of
@samp{finish} in the square dancing folklore seems to be a little more
complicated than that.  You should be careful when using this concept.
One call that is commonly used this way is @samp{finish like wheel the ocean}
after an appropriate @dfn{pushy} cast off 3/4.
In Sd, @code{finish wheel the ocean}
means to have the belles cross.  Hence you may, after carefully verifying that
the casting direction is correct, enter something like @code{chain reaction}
and @code{centers finish wheel the ocean}, which you could read as
@samp{chain reaction; centers finish like a wheel the ocean}.

@node 12 Matrix and 16 Matrix,  , Finish, Concept Notes
@section 12 Matrix and 16 Matrix

This discussion will be in terms of 12 matrices.  16 matrices are analogous.

Definition: a @dfn{large setup} is a setup of more than 8 people.
A @dfn{large call} is a call executed in such a setup.  There are very few
large calls that don't have some kind of modifier like @samp{12 MATRIX}
or @samp{3x3} in their name.

General principle:  when in a large setup, so that phantoms are present,
you must say something to acknowledge the existence of the phantoms, that
is, to say that the phantoms' spots count.  This is necessary whether doing
a large call, or splitting the large setup into smaller ones for doing small
calls.  So, for example, if you are in a parallelogram, you can't just say
the name of a large call.  You must say @samp{12 MATRIX} or @samp{2X6 MATRIX}.

The explicit matrix concepts @samp{MxN MATRIX}, e.g., @samp{2X6 MATRIX}, legitimize
the large setup, saying where the phantoms are, and making it possible to
call large calls, or, if the call has no large version, to split the setup
and do multiple instances of smaller versions.

Explicit matrix concepts can also be used to dictate the precise formation
with phantoms when using tandem or as-couples concepts.  For example, from
two-faced lines, @samp{2X8 MATRIX AS COUPLES} leads to virtual 2x4 lines (in
which the ends are all phantoms), @samp{4X4 MATRIX AS COUPLES} leads to virtual
2x4 columns (this happens to be the same as @samp{PHANTOM AS COUPLES} in this
setup), and @samp{4X4 MATRIX BOXES WORK SOLID} leads to a virtual 2x2.
@samp{2X8 MATRIX BOXES WORK SOLID} leads to a virtual 1x4.  From twin diamonds
in which each diamond has all 4 people facing the same way,
@samp{16 MATRIX OF PARALLEL DIAMONDS DIAMONDSOME} leads to a virtual 1x4
in which both ends are phantoms.  @samp{DIAMONDSOME} leads to a virtual 1x2.

The call size modifiers @samp{12 MATRIX} or @samp{16 MATRIX} legitimize the large setup
(though they don't always state unambiguously where the phantoms are, which
can lead to difficulty) and also select a large version of a call.  When
this modifier is used, only large versions of the call may be
performed---the setup will not be split for small versions.

When we say that @samp{12 MATRIX} is a call size modifier, we mean that, for
example, @samp{12 MATRIX relay the top} is a call.  @samp{3X4 MATRIX relay the top}
is not a call.  It is a statement that the setup is a legitimate 3x4,
and a request to do the call @samp{relay the top} in it, which is illegal.
There are some calls, like circulate, that can be done either with
explicit matrix concepts or with call size modifiers.

In a great many instances explicit matrix concepts like @samp{2X6 MATRIX} or
@samp{3X4 MATRIX} can be used interchangeably with the call size modifier
@samp{12 MATRIX}.  For example, @samp{2X6 MATRIX in roll circulate} and
@samp{12 MATRIX in roll circulate} are equivalent in 2x6 lines.
@samp{3X4 MATRIX circulate}
and @samp{12 MATRIX circulate} are equivalent in triple lines.  It should
never be necessary to give both an explicit matrix concept and a call
size modifier.

The explict matrix concepts and call size modifiers all have the additional
property that they can expand a smaller setup as required, so, for example,
@samp{12 MATRIX circulate} is legal in normal columns.
(Special case: in a 2x4
setup, the @samp{16 MATRIX} call modifier doesn't know whether to expand to a
4x4 or a 2x8, so you may need to use @samp{4X4 MATRIX} or @samp{2X8 MATRIX} explicitly.
In other cases, the expansion is clear.)


For example, from triple waves,
@code{12 MATRIX circulate}
and
@code{3X4 MATRIX circulate}
are both legal and equivalent.

From parallelogram waves,
@code{12 MATRIX circulate}
and
@code{2X6 MATRIX circulate}
are both legal and equivalent, as are
@code{12 MATRIX in roll circulate}
and
@code{2X6 MATRIX in roll circulate}.

@subsection Small Calls (defined for 8 or fewer people)

If a call is defined for a setup of 8 or fewer people, and the setup is larger
than 8 people, so you want the setup divided, you must give an explicit matrix
concept such as @samp{2X6 MATRIX}.  This defines the formation, and tells people
to divide the 12-person formation into the smaller formations required to do
the call.  Do not say @samp{12 MATRIX}.  That designates a 12-person call, which
this is not.

So, from parallelogram columns,
@code{2X6 MATRIX double play}
is legal, while
@code{12 MATRIX double play}
and
@code{double play}
are not.  You may also say
@code{12 MATRIX DIVIDED COLUMNS double play}.
(The 12 MATRIX DIVIDED COLUMNS concept forms two 6-person setups.)

The above examples will work from 2x4 columns also---it expands
the matrix by placing phantoms outside.

From triple waves, you may also say
@code{3X4 MATRIX double play}
or
@code{12 MATRIX SPLIT PHANTOM COLUMNS double play}
but not
@code{12 MATRIX double play}.

You may substitute calls like @samp{3x3 peel off} for @samp{double play} in the
above.  Note that the @samp{MxN} concept identifies a variant of the call.
It does not cause the matrix to be expanded or recognized.

@subsection Large Calls (defined for more than 8 people)

Most large calls are versions of calls that are normally done from small
setups.  That large version must be identified with some modifier such as
@samp{12 MATRIX}, or @samp{MxN}.  Furthermore, you must legitimize the phantoms by
giving an appropriate modifier.  An explicit matrix concept such as
@samp{2X6 MATRIX} will do, as will a call size modifier such as @samp{12 MATRIX}.

From parallelogram columns, you may say
@code{12 MATRIX circulate}
or
@code{2X6 MATRIX circulate}
or
@code{12 MATRIX 3X3 transfer the column}
or
@code{2X6 MATRIX 3X3 transfer the column}
but not
@code{3X3 transfer the column}.

The above examples will work from 2x4 columns also---it expands
the matrix by placing phantoms outside.

@chapter Miscellaneous Advice and Warnings

If a call that you believe is legal does not appear on the menu,
click on @code{allow modifications}.  This will bring up the universal call
menu.  You can then thrash out which of you or the computer is correct.

The program sometimes prints non-fatal @i{warnings} about calls.
These are intended
principally as advice to you, the user of the program, that the call
you have just entered may not be a reasonable thing to call.  It is not
necessarily the case that reading the warning aloud when calling the
sequence is the correct thing to do, though it might be.  The call
might simply be inappropriate, or it might be wise to say something along
the lines of ``be careful; everyone do your part.''
The significance of a warning may also depend on the level.  Some things
that are extremely peculiar but barely legal at high challenge levels are
simply not done at lower levels.  You should use your judgement.  

Warning:  The database is not without errors or misunderstandings in
nonstandard uses of calls.  The program generally tries to be extremely
conservative.  However,
you should not blindly accept what the program does, particularly if
a call was used in an unusual way.  The management will not be
responsible for any sequences left unattended.

Warning:  Some combinations of things that seem obvious
to the program might not be agreed to by the dancers.  Particularly
at high challenge levels, some things are controversial.  Proceed with
caution.  Unless you agree wholeheartedly with what the program did, and
believe that the dancers will also agree, it may be best not to do it.
Don't stack outrageous interrupts and replacements, with concepts going
every which way, unless you are prepared to explain yourself at the end
of the tip.

Warning:  The program's notion of levels is only keyed to concepts and
calls, not to concept/call combinations, and not to calls in the context
of certain setups.  For example, since @i{split} and @i{square thru} are
both Mainstream, it thinks that @i{split square thru} is Mainstream, even
though it is A1.  Also, @i{chain reaction} should only be used from the
simple @samp{heads pass the ocean} setup at A1, but the program doesn't
know this.

For debugging, there is a hidden level called @code{all}, which is above
C4.  At this level, even the invisible calls that are used in the
definitions of other calls are legal.  They typically begin with an
underscore.  Also, when the @code{all} level is selected, all
sequentially-defined calls are fractionalizable, even if they aren't in
practice.

The font for the text output window must be fixed-width so the
formation pictures are legible.  If you do not get this by default,
set this X resource:

@example
Sd*text*font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-c-70-iso8859-1
@end example

@chapter Customization with X Resources

The file @file{Sd.res} is a sample X user resource file for the program.  It
contains values for a number of parameters, including most of the
text on the screen which is not fetched from the calls database.
Install @file{Sd.res} as @file{$HOME/Sd} to use these resources.

People who have many user resource files for different applications
may wish to store them in a directory other than their home directory.
To do so, set the environment variable @code{XAPPLRESDIR} to the directory
where your resource files are.  For example, one of the authors uses
the subdirectory @file{app-resources}, and his .cshrc contains this line:

@example
setenv XAPPLRESDIR ~/app-resources
@end example

To use a different value for any of these parameters, either edit the
resource file or load the changed value into your X server's resource
database.  To modify the server resource database, put a modified
version of the appropriate line in the @file{.Xresources} file in your home
directory (assuming you run @code{xrdb .Xresources} from @file{.xsession} or
whatever your X startup file is called).  You will have to re-run @code{xrdb}
after editing your @file{.Xresources} file.
You should add @samp{Sd} to the front
of any lines you move to your @file{.Xresources} file.

All values in the distributed @file{Sd.res} file except the colors are the
defaults and are in the file for illustration only.  You can remove
them if you wish your installed user resource file to contain only the
resources you change.

To have mouse button 3 invoke the Undo operation, as one of the
authors does, set these resources:

@example
Sd*frame*Label*Translations: #override <Btn3Down>: undo()
Sd*frame*List*Translations: #override <Btn3Down>: undo()
@end example

@node Versions, Copying, Customization, Top
@chapter Versions

The version is a string consisting of parts separated by colons.

If you customize any part of Sd for your own use, or fix bugs, you should
assign the result a new version by appending to the current version.
This will help in keeping track of bug reports.  The version string is
defined near the top of the file @file{sdmain.c}.  For example, you might
set it to @code{25.6.joe1} for your private version.

The calls database also has a version.
If you modify the database, you should
change the version string at the top of the file.
