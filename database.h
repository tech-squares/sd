   The last bunch of flags are pushed up against the high end of the word, so that
   they can exactly match some other flags.  The constant HERITABLE_FLAG_MASK

   in sd.h, the "cflag__xxx" group in database.h, and the "dfm_xxx" group in
   database.h . There is compile-time code in sdinit.c to check that these
