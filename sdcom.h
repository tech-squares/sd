/* Flags that reside in the "result_flags" word of a setup AFTER a call is executed.

   The low two bits tell, for a 2x2 setup after
   having a call executed, how that 2x2 is elongated in the east-west or
   north-south direction.  Since 2x2's are always totally canonical, the
   interpretation of the elongation direction is always absolute.  A 1 in this
   field means the elongation is east-west.  A 2 means the elongation is
   north-south.  A zero means the elongation is unknown.  These bits will be set
   whenever we know which elongation is preferred.  This will be the case if the
   setup was an elongated 2x2 prior to the call (because they are the ends), or
   the setup was a 1x4 prior to the call.  So, for example, after any recycle
   from a wave, these bits will be set to indicate that the dancers want to
   elongate the 2x2 perpendicular to their original wave.  These bits will be
   looked at only if the call was directed to the ends (starting from a grand
   wave, for example.)  Furthermore, the bits will be overridden if the
   "concentric" or "checkpoint" concepts were used, or if the ends did this
   as part of a concentrically defined call for which some forcing modifier
   such as "force_columns" was used.  Note that these two bits are in the same
   format as the "cmd.prior_elongation" field of a setup before the call is
   executed.  In many case, that field can be simply copied into the "result_flags"
   field.

   RESULTFLAG__DID_LAST_PART means that, when a sequentially defined call was executed
   with the "cmd_frac_flags" word nonzero, so that just one part was done,
   that part was the last part.  Hence, if we are doing a call with some "piecewise"
   or "random" concept, we do the parts of the call one at a time, with appropriate
   concepts on each part, until it comes back with this flag set.  This is used with
   RESULTFLAG__PARTS_ARE_KNOWN.

   RESULTFLAG__PARTS_ARE_KNOWN means that the bit in RESULTFLAG__DID_LAST_PART is
   valid.  Sometimes we are unable to obtain information about parts, because
   no one is doing the call.  This can legally happen, for example, on "interlocked
   parallelogram leads shakedown while the trailers star thru" from waves.  In each
   virtual 2x2 setup one or the other of the calls is being done by no one.

   RESULTFLAG__EXPAND_TO_2X3 means that a call was executed that takes a four person
   starting setup (typically a line) and yields a 2x3 result setup.  Two of those
   result spots will be phantoms, of course.  When recombining a divided setup in
   which such a call was executed, if the recombination wuold yield a 2x6, and if
   the center 4 spots would be empty, this flag directs divided_setup_move to
   collapse the setup to a 2x4.  This is what makes calls like "pair the line"
   and "step and slide" behave correctly from parallel lines and from a grand line.

   RESULTFLAG__NEED_DIAMOND means that a call has been executed with the "magic" or
   "interlocked" modifier, and it really should be changed to the "magic diamond"
   concept.  Otherwise, we might end up saying "magic diamond single wheel" when
   we should have said "magic diamond, diamond single wheel".

   RESULTFLAG__SPLIT_AXIS_MASK has info saying whether the call was split
   vertically (2) or horizontally (1) in "absolute space".  We can't say for
   sure whether the orientation is absolute, since a client may have stripped
   out rotation info.  What we mean is that it is relative to the incoming setup
   including the effect of its rotation field.  So, if the incoming setup was
   a 2x4 with rotation=0, that is, horizontally oriented in "absolute space",
   1 means it was done in 2x2's (split horizontally) and 2 means it was done
   in 1x4's (split vertically).  If the incoming setup was a 2x4 with
   rotation=1, that is, vertically oriented in "absolute space", 1 means it
   was done in 1x4's (split horizontally) and 2 means it was done in 2x2's
   (split vertically).  3 means that the call was a 1 or 2 person call, that
   could be split either way, so we have no information.

   RESULTFLAG__ACTIVE_PHANTOMS_ON and _OFF tell whether the state of the "active
   phantoms" mode flag was used in this sequence.  If it was read and found to
   be on, RESULTFLAG__ACTIVE_PHANTOMS_ON is set.  If it was read and found to
   be off, RESULTFLAG__ACTIVE_PHANTOMS_OFF is set.  It is, of course, read any
   time an "assume <whatever> concept is invoked.  This information is used to
   tell what kind of annotation to place in the transcript file to tell what
   assumptions were made.  The reason for having both bits is that the state
   of the active phantoms mode can be toggled at arbitrary times, so a single
   card might have both usages.  In that unusual case, we want to so indicate
   on the card.

   CONCPROP__NEEDK_2X8   the top level, the existing setup should be expanded as needed.

      for transmission back to the client.  Normally this is off, and the split axis bits
      will be cleared after execution of the concept.

   CONCPROP__NEED_ARG2_MATRIX means that the "arg2" word of the concept_descriptor
      block contains additional bits of the "CONCPROP__NEEDK_3X8" kind to be sent to
      "do_matrix_expansion".  This is done so that concepts with different matrix
