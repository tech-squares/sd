/* We would like to not need to customize things for different "dialects" of
   ANSI C, because we would like to think that there are no "dialects".  But, alas,
   there are two issues:
   (1) Some versions of GNU C (gcc) recognize the "volatile" keyword on a procedure
      as indicating that its call-return behavior is anomalous, and generate
      better code with that knowledge.  We can take advantage of that for some
      of our functions that never return, so we define a keyword "nonreturning".
   (2) Some compilers trying to pass for ANSI C have been observed failing
      to handle the "const" attribute.  (Yes, an ANSI C compiler that doesn't handle
      "const" is an oxymoron.)  We grudgingly accept such compilers if the
      "CONST_IS_BROKEN" symbol is defined.  We allow that to be set by a Makefile,
      and we set it ourselves for those compilers that we know about. */

/* Flags that reside in the "cmd_misc_flags" word of a setup BEFORE a call is executed.

   BEWARE!! These flags co-exist in the cmd_misc_flags word with copies of some
   of the call invocation flags.  The mask for those flags is
   DFM1_CONCENTRICITY_FLAG_MASK.  Those flags, and that mask, are defined
   in database.h .  We define these flags at the extreme left end of the
   word in order to keep them away from the concentricity flags.

   CMD_MISC__DISTORTED means that we are at a level of recursion in which some
   distorted-setup concept has been used.  When this is set, "matrix" (a.k.a.
   "space invader") calls, such as press and truck, are not permitted.  Sorry, Clark.

   CMD_MISC__OFFSET_Z means that we are doing a 2x3 call (the only known case
   of this is "Z axle") that came from Z's picked out of a 4x4 setup.  The map
   that we are using has a "50% offset" map schema, so that, if the call goes
   into 1x4's (which Z axle does) it will put the results into a parallelogram,
   in accordance with customary usage.  The problem is that, if the call goes
   into a setup other than a 1x4 oriented in the appropriate way, using the
   50% offset schema will lead to the wrong result.  For example, if a call
   were defined that went from Z's into 2x2's, the program would attempt to
   bizarrely offset boxes.  (Yes, I know that Z axle is the only call in the
   database that can cause Z's to be picked out of a 4x4.  The program is just
   trying to be very careful.)  So, when this flag is on and a shape-changer
   occurs, the program insists on a parallelogram result.

   CMD_MISC__SAID_SPLIT means that we are at a level of recursion in which
   the "split" concept has been used.  When this is on, it is not permissible
   to do a 4-person call that has not 8-person definition, and hence would have
   been done the same way without the "split" concept.  This prevents superfluous
   things like "split pass thru".

   CMD_MISC__SAID_TRIANGLE means that we are at a level of recursion in which
   the word "triangle" has been uttered, so it is OK to do things like "triangle
   peel and trail" without giving the explicit "triangle" concept again.  This
   makes it possible to say things like "tandem-based triangles peel and trail".

   CMD_MISC__DO_AS_COUPLES means the obvious thing.

   CMD_FRAC__FRACTIONALIZE_MASK is a 9 bit field that is nonzero when some form
   of fractionalization control is in use.  These bits are set up by concepts like
   "random" and "fractional", and are used in sdmoves.c to control sequentially
   defined calls.  See the comments there for details.

   CMD_MISC__NO_CHK_ELONG means that the elongation of the incoming setup is for
   informational purposes only (to tell where people should finish) and should not
   be used for raising error messages.  It suppresses the error that would be
   raised if we have people in a facing 2x2 star thru when they are far from the
   ones they are facing.

   CMD_MISC__PHANTOMS means that we are at a level of recursion in which some phantom
   concept has been used, or when "on your own" or "so-and-so do your part" concepts
   are in use.  It indicates that we shouldn't be surprised if there are phantoms
   in the setup.  When this is set, the "tandem" or "as couples" concepts will
   forgive phantoms wherever they might appear, so that "split phantom lines tandem
   <call>" is legal.  Otherwise, we would have to say "split phantom lines phantom
   tandem <call>.  This flag also allows "basic_move" to be more creative about
   inferring the starting position for a call.  If I know that I am doing a
   "so-and-so do your part" operation, it may well be that, even though the setup
   is, say, point-to-point diamonds, the centers of the diamonds are none of my
   business (I am a point), and I want to think of the setup as a grand wave,
   so I can do my part of a grand mix.  The "CMD_MISC__PHANTOMS" flag makes it
   possible to do a grand mix from point-to-point diamonds in which the centers
   are absent.

   CMD_MISC__NO_STEP_TO_WAVE means that we are at a level of recursion that no longer permits us to do the
   implicit step to a wave or rear back from one that some calls permit at the top level.

   CMD_MISC__ASSUME_WAVES means that the "assume waves" concept has been given.

   CMD_MISC__EXPLICIT_MIRROR means that the setup has been mirrored by the "mirror"
   concept, separately from anything done by "left" or "reverse".  Such a mirroring
   does NOT cause the "take right hands" stuff to compensate by going to left hands,
   so it has the effect of making the people physically take left hands.

   CMD_MISC__EXPLICIT_MATRIX means that the caller said "4x4 matrix" or "2x6 matrix" or whatever,
   so we got to this matrix explicitly.  This enables natural splitting of the setup, e.g. form
   a parallelogram, "2x6 matrix 1x2 checkmate" is legal -- the 2x6 gets divided naturally
   into 2x3's.

   CMD_MISC__NO_EXPAND_MATRIX means that we are at a level of recursion that no longer permits us to do the
   implicit expansion of the matrix (e.g. add outboard phantoms to turn a 2x4 into a 2x6
   if the concept "triple box" is used) that some concepts perform at the top level.

   CMD_MISC__DOING_ENDS means that this call is directed only to the ends (and the setup is the ends
   of the original setup.  If the call turns out to be an 8-person call with distinct
   centers and ends parts, we may want to just apply the ends part.  This is what
   makes "ends detour" work.

/* Flags that reside in the "result_flags" word of a setup AFTER a call is executed.

   The low two bits tell, for a 2x2 setup after
   having a call executed, how that 2x2 is elongated in the east-west or
   north-south direction.  Since 2x2's are always totally canonical, the
   interpretation of the elongation direction is always absolute.  A 1 in this
   field means the elongation is east-west.  A 2 means the elongation is
   north-south.  A zero means the elongation is unknown.  These bits will be set
   whenever we know which elongation is preferred.  This will be the case if the
   setup was an elongated 2x2 prior to the call (because they are the ends), or
   the setup was a 1x4 prior to the call.  So, for example, after any recycle
   from a wave, these bits will be set to indicate that the dancers want to
   elongate the 2x2 perpendicular to their original wave.  These bits will be
   looked at only if the call was directed to the ends (starting from a grand
   wave, for example.)  Furthermore, the bits will be overridden if the
   "concentric" or "checkpoint" concepts were used, or if the ends did this
   as part of a concentrically defined call for which some forcing modifier
   such as "force_columns" was used.  Note that these two bits are in the same
   format as the "cmd.prior_elongation" field of a setup before the call is
   executed.  In many case, that field can be simply copied into the "result_flags"
   field.

   RESULTFLAG__DID_LAST_PART means that, when a sequentially defined call was executed
   with the CMD_FRAC__FRACTIONALIZE_MASK nonzero, so that just one part was done,
   that part was the last part.  Hence, if we are doing a call with some "piecewise"
   or "random" concept, we do that parts of the call one at a time, with appropriate
   concepts on each part, until it comes back with this flag set.

   RESULTFLAG__EXPAND_TO_2X3 means that a call was executed that takes a four person
   starting setup (typically a line) and yields a 2x3 result setup.  Two of those
   result spots will be phantoms, of course.  When recombining a divided setup in
   which such a call was executed, if the recombination wuold yield a 2x6, and if
   the center 4 spots would be empty, this flag directs divided_setup_move to
   collapse the setup to a 2x4.  This is what makes calls like "pair the line"
   and "step and slide" behave correctly from parallel lines and from a grand line.

   RESULTFLAG__NEED_DIAMOND means that a call has been executed with the "magic" or
   "interlocked" modifier, and it really should be changed to the "magic diamond"
   concept.  Otherwise, we might end up saying "magic diamond single wheel" when
   we should have said "magic diamond, diamond single wheel".

   RESULTFLAG__SPLIT_AXIS_MASK has info saying whether the call was split
   vertically (2) or horizontally (1) in "absolute space".  We can't say for
   sure whether the orientation is absolute, since a client may have stripped
   out rotation info.  What we mean is that it is relative to the incoming setup
   including the effect of its rotation field.  So, if the incoming setup was
   a 2x4 with rotation=0, that is, horizontally oriented in "absolute space",
   1 means it was done in 2x2's (split horizontally) and 2 means it was done
   in 1x4's (split vertically).  If the incoming setup was a 2x4 with
   rotation=1, that is, vertically oriented in "absolute space", 1 means it
   was done in 1x4's (split horizontally) and 2 means it was done in 2x2's
   (split vertically).  3 means that the call was a 1 or 2 person call, that
   could be split either way, so we have no information.

   CONCPROP__SECOND_CALL means that the concept takes a second call, so a sublist must

   CONCPROP__USE_SELECTOR means that the concept requires a selector, which must be
      inserted into the concept list just after the concept pointer.

   CONCPROP__NEED_4X4   mean that the concept requires the indicated setup, and, at
   CONCPROP__NEED_2X8   the top level, the existing setup should be expanded as needed.
   CONCPROP__NEED_2X6 
   CONCPROP__NEED_4DMD

      pair someone with a phantom.  It is what makes "split phantom lines tandem"
      work, so that "split phantom lines phantom tandem" is unnecessary.

   CONCPROP__NO_STEP means that stepping to a wave or rearing back from one is not
      allowed under this concept.

   CONCPROP__GET_MASK means that tbonetest & livemask need to be computed before executing the concept.

   CONCPROP__STANDARD means that the concept can be "standard".

   CONCPROP__USE_NUMBER         If a concept takes one number, only CONCPROP__USE_NUMBER is set.
   CONCPROP__USE_TWO_NUMBERS    If it takes two numbers both bits are set.

   CONCPROP__SHOW_SPLIT means that the concept prepares the "split_axis" bits properly
      for transmission back to the client.  Normally this is off, and the split axis bits
      will be cleared after execution of the concept.
