// In several places in this program, we use C-style static aggregate
// initializers.  Specifically, sdtables.cpp and sdctable.cpp are full of them.
// Some of them are absolutely enormous.  The C++ language sort of frowns on
// that style of initialization.  The C++ way would be to use constructors,
// writing the appropriate code to invoke the constructors in the proper way.
// While we have some sympathy with this style in many cases, we prefer the
// C-style direct initializers for most of the big tables.  The reason is that
// the benefits of C++ constructors seem infinitesimal for these tables, and
// they would sacrifice transparency: with the direct initializers, you can
// look at the struct definition in sd.h and look at the initializer in
// sdtables.cpp and know for sure, without worrying about what clever things
// the constructor might do, which constant belongs in which field.
//
// Because we are initializing things in ways that C++ frowns on, the
// C++ compiler punishes us by not letting us declare fields "const".
// This is unfortunate.  We attach great importance to the ability of
// the C/C++ type mechanism to prevent table overwrites.  (In fact, a
// test compilation of a competing program with "const" declarators on
// these tables revealed an astonishing bug.)
//
// For a while, we solved this problem by putting the initializers in
// plain C files (sdtables.c and sdctable.c) and linking with the other
// C++ files.  Not surprisingly, this created difficulties.  In the end,
// it became unworkable, and now all files are C++.
//
// By the way, one of the problems was that the Intel compiler saw what
// we were doing in the C++ files, realized that we could not possibly
// initialize the structures legally, and gave a warning.  What it
// overlooked was that we were linking with C files to do what would
// have been impossible in C++.  For reference, the incantation to
// shut off the warning was:
//     #if defined(WIN32) && defined(__ICL)
//     #pragma warning(disable: 411)
//     #endif
//
// Because what we really want is the protection against overwriting
// that the "const" declaration would provide, we define the initialized
// tables, and the definition of their structure, in classes.  The tables
// themselves are private.  So that is why you see all these classes
// that have no members, but have statically initialized structs.

//  (1) The "number_fields" part of a call_conc_option_state.
//         This has the numbers (up to four of them) that the user entered
//         with a call or concept, as in "3/4 crazy" or "cast off 1/2".  Those
//         numbers are packed in right-to-left order.  So, for example, "circle
//         by 1/2 by 3/4" will have 0/0/3/2 in those fields (this call takes its
//         numeric arguments in quarters).  The "do the last 3/5" concept will
//         have 0/0/5/3 in those fields.  The parser will never put a number
//         larger than 36 (NUM_CARDINALS-1) in the "number_fields" word.
//
//  (2) The "fraction" field of a "fraction_command".  This also takes four

//         numbers, though there is no direct correspondence with the other
//         usage described above.  The four numbers are the numerators and
//         denominators of the starting and ending points of the desired part of
//         the call.  The layout is
//         <start den> / <start num> / <end den> / <end num>.  To do the whole

/* Flags that reside in the "result_flags" word of a setup AFTER a call is executed.

   The low two bits tell, for a 2x2 setup after
   having a call executed, how that 2x2 is elongated in the east-west or
   north-south direction.  Since 2x2's are always totally canonical, the
   interpretation of the elongation direction is always absolute.  A 1 in this
   field means the elongation is east-west.  A 2 means the elongation is
   north-south.  A zero means the elongation is unknown.  These bits will be set
   whenever we know which elongation is preferred.  This will be the case if the
   setup was an elongated 2x2 prior to the call (because they are the ends), or
   the setup was a 1x4 prior to the call.  So, for example, after any recycle
   from a wave, these bits will be set to indicate that the dancers want to
   elongate the 2x2 perpendicular to their original wave.  These bits will be
   looked at only if the call was directed to the ends (starting from a grand
   wave, for example.)  Furthermore, the bits will be overridden if the
   "concentric" or "checkpoint" concepts were used, or if the ends did this
   as part of a concentrically defined call for which some forcing modifier
   such as "force_columns" was used.  Note that these two bits are in the same
   format as the "cmd.prior_elongation" field of a setup before the call is
   executed.  In many case, that field can be simply copied into the "result_flags"
   field.

   RESULTFLAG__DID_LAST_PART means that, when a sequentially defined call was executed
   with the "cmd_frac_flags" word nonzero, so that just one part was done,
   that part was the last part.  Hence, if we are doing a call with some "piecewise"
   or "random" concept, we do the parts of the call one at a time, with appropriate
   concepts on each part, until it comes back with this flag set.  This is used with
   RESULTFLAG__PARTS_ARE_KNOWN.

   RESULTFLAG__PARTS_ARE_KNOWN means that the bit in RESULTFLAG__DID_LAST_PART is
   valid.  Sometimes we are unable to obtain information about parts, because
   no one is doing the call.  This can legally happen, for example, on "interlocked
   parallelogram leads shakedown while the trailers star thru" from waves.  In each
   virtual 2x2 setup one or the other of the calls is being done by no one.

   RESULTFLAG__EXPAND_TO_2X3 means that a call was executed that takes a four person
   starting setup (typically a line) and yields a 2x3 result setup.  Two of those
   result spots will be phantoms, of course.  When recombining a divided setup in
   which such a call was executed, if the recombination wuold yield a 2x6, and if
   the center 4 spots would be empty, this flag directs divided_setup_move to
   collapse the setup to a 2x4.  This is what makes calls like "pair the line"
   and "step and slide" behave correctly from parallel lines and from a grand line.

   RESULTFLAG__NEED_DIAMOND means that a call has been executed with the "magic" or
   "interlocked" modifier, and it really should be changed to the "magic diamond"
   concept.  Otherwise, we might end up saying "magic diamond single wheel" when
   we should have said "magic diamond, diamond single wheel".

   RESULTFLAG__ACTIVE_PHANTOMS_ON and _OFF tell whether the state of the "active
   phantoms" mode flag was used in this sequence.  If it was read and found to
   be on, RESULTFLAG__ACTIVE_PHANTOMS_ON is set.  If it was read and found to
   be off, RESULTFLAG__ACTIVE_PHANTOMS_OFF is set.  It is, of course, read any
   time an "assume <whatever> concept is invoked.  This information is used to
   tell what kind of annotation to place in the transcript file to tell what
   assumptions were made.  The reason for having both bits is that the state
   of the active phantoms mode can be toggled at arbitrary times, so a single
   card might have both usages.  In that unusual case, we want to so indicate
   on the card.

   RESULTFLAG__DID_SHORT6_2X3 means that we fudged a short6 to a 2x3
   (with permission), and, if we are putting back a concentric formation,
   we may need to act accordingly.

   The "split_info" field has info saying whether the call was split
   vertically (2) or horizontally (1) in "absolute space".  We can't say for
   sure whether the orientation is absolute, since a client may have stripped
   out rotation info.  What we mean is that it is relative to the incoming setup
   including the effect of its rotation field.  So, if the incoming setup was
   a 2x4 with rotation=0, that is, horizontally oriented in "absolute space",
   1 means it was done in 2x2's (split horizontally) and 2 means it was done
   in 1x4's (split vertically).  If the incoming setup was a 2x4 with
   rotation=1, that is, vertically oriented in "absolute space", 1 means it
   was done in 1x4's (split horizontally) and 2 means it was done in 2x2's
   (split vertically).  3 means that the call was a 1 or 2 person call, that
   could be split either way, so we have no information.

      we reach the end of a subtree of big concepts, at which point we read
      the remaining "small" (or "final") concepts and the call name out of
      the end of the concept parse tree.

   callspec
      The call, after we reach the end of the parse tree.

   cmd_final_flags
      The various "final concept" flags with names INHERITFLAG_??? and FINAL__???.
      The INHERITFLAG_??? bits contain the final concepts like "single" that
      can be inherited from one part of a call definition to another.  The
      FINAL__??? bits contain other miscellaneous final concepts.

   cmd_misc_flags
      Other miscellaneous info controlling the execution of the call,
      with names like CMD_MISC__???.

   cmd_misc2_flags
      Even more miscellaneous info controlling the execution of the call,
      with names like CMD_MISC2__???.

   do_couples_heritflags
      These are "heritable" flags that tell what single/3x3/etc modifiers
      are to be used in determining what to do when CMD_MISC__DO_AS_COUPLES
      is specified.

   cmd_frac_flags
      If nonzero, fractionalization info controlling the execution of the call.
      See the comments in front of "get_fraction_info" in sdmoves.cpp for details.

   cmd_assume
      Any "assume waves" type command.

   skippable_concept
      For "<so-and-so> work <concept>", this is the concept to be skipped by some people.

   skippable_heritflags
      As above, when it's a simple modifier.

   prior_elongation_bits;
      This tells, for a 2x2 setup prior to having a call executed, how that
      2x2 is elongated (due to these people being the outsides) in the east-west
      or north-south direction.  Since 2x2's are always totally canonical, the
      interpretation of the elongation direction is always absolute.  A 1 means
      the elongation is east-west.  A 2 means the elongation is north-south.
      A zero means there was no elongation. */


/* Flags that reside in the "cmd_misc_flags" word of a setup BEFORE a call is executed.

   BEWARE!! These flags co-exist in the cmd_misc_flags word with copies of some
   of the call invocation flags.  The mask for those flags is
   DFM1_CONCENTRICITY_FLAG_MASK.  Those flags, and that mask, are defined
   in database.h .  We must define these flags starting where the concentricity
   flags end.

   CMD_MISC__EXPLICIT_MIRROR means that the setup has been mirrored by the "mirror"
   concept, separately from anything done by "left" or "reverse".  Such a mirroring
   does NOT cause the "take right hands" stuff to compensate by going to left hands,
   so it has the effect of making the people physically take left hands.

   CMD_MISC__MATRIX_CONCEPT means that the "matrix" concept has been given, and we have
   to be very careful about what we can do.  Specifically, this will make everything illegal
   except calls to suitable "split phantom" concepts.

   CMD_MISC__VERIFY_WAVES means that, before doing the call, we have to act as though the
   "assume waves" concept had been given.  That is, we have to verify that the setup is in fact
   waves, and we have to set the assumption stuff, so that a "with active phantoms" concept
   can be handled.  This flag is used only through "divided_setup_move", to propagate
   information from a concept like "split phantom waves" through the division, and then
   cause the assumption to be acted upon in each resulting setup.  It is removed immediately
   by "divided_setup_move" after use.

   CMD_MISC__EXPLICIT_MATRIX means that the caller said "4x4 matrix" or "2x6 matrix" or whatever,
   so we got to this matrix explicitly.  This enables natural splitting of the setup, e.g. form
   a parallelogram, "2x6 matrix 1x2 checkmate" is legal -- the 2x6 gets divided naturally
   into 2x3's.

   CMD_MISC__NO_EXPAND_MATRIX means that we are at a level of recursion that
   no longer permits us to do the implicit expansion of the matrix
   (e.g. add outboard phantoms to turn a 2x4 into a 2x6 if the concept
   "triple box" is used) that some concepts perform at the top level.

   CMD_MISC__DISTORTED means that we are at a level of recursion in which some
   distorted-setup concept has been used.  When this is set, "matrix" (a.k.a.
   "space invader") calls, such as press and truck, are not permitted.  Sorry, Clark.

   CMD_MISC__OFFSET_Z means that we are doing a 2x3 call (the only known case
   of this is "Z axle") that came from Z's picked out of a 4x4 setup.  The map
   that we are using has a "50% offset" map schema, so that, if the call goes
   into 1x4's (which Z axle does) it will put the results into a parallelogram,
   in accordance with customary usage.  The problem is that, if the call goes
   into a setup other than a 1x4 oriented in the appropriate way, using the
   50% offset schema will lead to the wrong result.  For example, if a call
   were defined that went from Z's into 2x2's, the program would attempt to
   bizarrely offset boxes.  (Yes, I know that Z axle is the only call in the
   database that can cause Z's to be picked out of a 4x4.  The program is just
   trying to be very careful.)  So, when this flag is on and a shape-changer
   occurs, the program insists on a parallelogram result.

   CMD_MISC__SAID_SPLIT means that we are at a level of recursion in which
   the "split" concept has been used.  When this is on, it is not permissible
   to do a 4-person call that has not 8-person definition, and hence would have
   been done the same way without the "split" concept.  This prevents superfluous
   things like "split pass thru".

   CMD_MISC__SAID_TRIANGLE means that we are at a level of recursion in which
   the word "triangle" has been uttered, so it is OK to do things like "triangle
   peel and trail" without giving the explicit "triangle" concept again.  This
   makes it possible to say things like "tandem-based triangles peel and trail".

   CMD_MISC__DO_AS_COUPLES means that the "couples_unless_single" invocation
   flag is on, and the call may need to be done as couples or whatever.  The
   bits in "do_couples_heritflags" control this.  If INHERITFLAG_SINGLE is on,
   do not do it as couples.  If off, do it as couples.  If various other bits
   are on (e.g. INHERITFLAG_1X3), do the appropriate thing.

   CMD_MISC__NO_CHK_ELONG means that the elongation of the incoming setup is for
   informational purposes only (to tell where people should finish) and should not
   be used for raising error messages.  It suppresses the error that would be
   raised if we have people in a facing 2x2 star thru when they are far from the
   ones they are facing.

   CMD_MISC__PHANTOMS means that we are at a level of recursion in which some phantom
   concept has been used, or when "on your own" or "so-and-so do your part" concepts
   are in use.  It indicates that we shouldn't be surprised if there are phantoms
   in the setup.  When this is set, the "tandem" or "as couples" concepts will
   forgive phantoms wherever they might appear, so that "split phantom lines tandem
   <call>" is legal.  Otherwise, we would have to say "split phantom lines phantom
   tandem <call>.  This flag also allows "basic_move" to be more creative about
   inferring the starting position for a call.  If I know that I am doing a
   "so-and-so do your part" operation, it may well be that, even though the setup
   is, say, point-to-point diamonds, the centers of the diamonds are none of my
   business (I am a point), and I want to think of the setup as a grand wave,
   so I can do my part of a grand mix.  The "CMD_MISC__PHANTOMS" flag makes it
   possible to do a grand mix from point-to-point diamonds in which the centers
   are absent.

   CMD_MISC__NO_STEP_TO_WAVE means that we are at a level of recursion that
   no longer permits us to do the implicit step to a wave or rear back from one
   that some calls permit at the top level.

   CMD_MISC__DOING_ENDS means that this call is directed only to the ends
   of the original setup.  If the call turns out to be an 8-person call with distinct
   centers and ends parts, we may want to just apply the ends part.  This is what
   makes "ends detour" work.

//
//    CMD_MISC2__CTR_END_INVERT means that the call is being inverted.  It is
