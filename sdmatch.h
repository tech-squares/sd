/*
 * A match_result describes the result of matching a string against
 * a set of acceptable commands. A match_result is effectively a
 * sequence of values to be returned to the main program. A sequence
 * is required because the main program asks for information in
 * bits and pieces.  For example, the call "touch 1/4" first returns
 * "touch <N/4>" and then returns "1".  This structure for the
 * interaction between the main program and the UI reflects the
 * design of the original Domain Dialog UI.
